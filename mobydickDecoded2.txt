and this is the key to it all.  now, when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger. for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. besides, passengers get sea~sick~~grow quarrelsome~~don~t sleep of nights~~do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;~~no, i never go as a passenger; nor, though i am something of a salt, do i ever go to sea as a commodore, or a captain, or a cook. i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. for my part, i abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques,nbriks.nssjoumars,namd:whatn ox! a lmas horngoengnec siug,~~tjiuch i su fazcntjerinis cinsoderabde glury im xjat,:a cooknbeing ansorx:of offiger on shop~poard~~yet, somehov, i naver fancied broiling fowls;~~though once broiled, judiciously buttered,:and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled howlnthan i will. it is out of the idolaxrous dotings of the old acyptianc:upi npriilelnobis emd roastid lovel hohca, thatnwou zea:the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake~houses the pyramids.  no, when i go to sea, i go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast~head. true, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a may meadow. and at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. it touches one~s sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the van rensselaefs, or randolphs, or hardicanutes. and more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar~pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. the transition is a keen one, i assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. but even this wears off in time.  what of it, if some old hunks of a sea~captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? what does that indignity amount to;nweighed. i mean,:in:thencsales oh tje nav testament0 do younthong the afchangel gabriil thinks anything the less of me, because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? who ain~t a slave? tell me that. well, then, however the old sea~captains may order me about~~however they may thump and punch me about, i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other servednon much tfe same way~~either in a bhwsical or metaqhysical qoe tnif voew,:tjax is;:anlnsonxje umivirsel tfymp:ec pascidnrount;na t:eld h~ ds shoudd rub:eachnothef~z shoulder~blades, a d bincontent!  again, i always go to sea ac a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of. on the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. and there is all the difherence in the world between paying and being paid. the act oh paying es qaffaqs tfinmost yncomforxabra i flikdoon thad the tvi orchard thieves entailed upon us. but being paid,~~what will compare with it? the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!  finally, i always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore~castle deck. for as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than wints:hromnastarm athatnis;:if:wiu nivel veolada tfi:pythekofean netija;
