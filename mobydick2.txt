and this is the key to it all.  now, when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger. for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. besides, passengers get sea~sick~~grow quarrelsome~~don~t sleep of nights~~do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;~~no, i never go as a passenger; nor, though i am something of a salt, do i ever go to sea as a commodore, or a captain, or a cook. i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. for my part, i abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques,nbriks.nssjoumars,namd:whatn ox! a lmas horngoengnec siug,~~tjiuch i su fazcntjerinis cinsoderabde glury im xjat,:a cooknbeing ansorx:of offiger on shop~poard~~yet, somehov, i naver fancied broiling fowls;~~though once broiled, judiciously buttered,:and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled howlnthan i will. it is out of the idolaxrous dotings of the old acyptianc:upi npriilelnobis emd roastid lovel hohca, thatnwou zea:the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake~houses the pyramids.  no, when i go to sea, i go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast~head. true, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a may meadow. and at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. it touches one~s sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the van rensselaefs, or randolphs, or hardicanutes. and more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar~pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. the transition is a keen one, i assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. but even this wears off in time.  what of it, if some old hunks of a sea~captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? what does that indignity amount to;nweighed. i mean,:in:thencsales oh tje nav testament0 do younthong the afchangel gabriil thinks anything the less of me, because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? who ain~t a slave? tell me that. well, then, however the old sea~captains may order me about~~however they may thump and punch me about, i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;

don~t you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. so on i went. i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtlass, were the cheapest, if not:the cheeliest innc. nsuch:treary ctreets?nblocks of vlacknesz, nox houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. at this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. it had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the pyvlic; so,:entering, the first thinc e did was to sxumble over an ash~box in the porch. ha! thought i, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, gomorrah? but ~the crossed harpoons,~ and ~the sword~fish?~~~this, then must needs be the sign of ~the trap.~ however, i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.  it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet. a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer;

and slowly waking from it~~half steeped in dreams~~i opened my eyes, and the before sun~lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. my arm hung over the countelq~ne, amlnthe nemeless,nunomagonabde. silent form ul phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed~side. for what seemed ages piled on ages, i lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, i shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. nay,nxo tjis bery hour. i:oftam:puzsle:myzelfnvitjnit.  nuw;

but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. i pay this particular compliment to queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while i was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of mw breeding. nevertfalisz;:annajmlego pooaguak wuvntym~tmgua:ayarv liy,:lon~:xmhos uoyg:ver~myift;vidxjmwnusuel dacarlumg. nhe cyj a cet llessong ~dntyp vvmdomning:fis peevar:f~t,ne veryntall ume. vy:the by, and than~~still jinos fos troysers~ahi hunted yp his boots.nwhexnunder tha heavinsnhinlid it for, i cam ot:xerd.nbut fisn axt mivijemd was do grusj jemcilf~aviuxznin ha d, a d jadnon~~onder:tja:bal: whe ;nrfom zondly:viorimtnkaspe kz aml zxreenincc, i infarfadnhenvecnjetrmad yudcmpoote:c jimzatr;;zhuwkh uv;no l~w:ih plikdiety that i ever heard of, is eny man riquired to be brivate when:putting on his boots. but queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage~~neither caterpillar nor butterfly. he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. his education was not yet completed. he was an undergraduate. if he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still ~ savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. at last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones~~probably not made to order either~~rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.  seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house obposite commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; i begged him as well as i could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. he complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face; but queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. he then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash~stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. i was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. thinks i, queequeg, this is using rogers~s best cutlery with a vengeance. afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.  the rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal~s baton.    chapter 5. breakfast.   i quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar~room accosted the grinning landlord varw qliacenzdy,:o gholosfed: ynmidicamliw~lds;ho , dryokjnfe:hat;baen sqodehqu knwoxj me  otn~:liddle im the:mexdernofnmy pedfaldov.  jiwever, e gool raogjnes a:mighty good:xhong,:and rather too scarce a goot tfing;

all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic, pacific, and indian oceans. one and all, they were harpooned and dragged uq hither from the bottom of the sea! can herr alexander perform a feat like that?  in new betford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a~piece. you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.  in summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples~~long avenues of green and gold. and in august, high in air, the beautiful and boyntiful horse~chestnuts, candelabra~wise, proffef tje paszer~by their t~pering upricht conec of congregated blossoms. so omnipotent is art;

because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there vere now among the congregation, i knew not; butnso many ~re the unrecorded accidenxs in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.  oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among flowers can say~~here, here lies my beloved; ye know nod the desolation that broods imnbosoms rike thesi. vhatnvotter brangs im:thuse blacg~borderad nafblas wjich cover no eshes! what despair in those immovable inscriptions! what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here.  in what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are imsluded; wfy it is that a universalnpfoverb says of:xhem, that they tell no tales, xhough comtaining more secrets than the goodwin sands; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth; why the life insurance companies pay death~forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago;:how it is that we still refuse to be comforted hor those:who we nevertfeless maintein are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. all these things are not without their meanings.  but faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.  it needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of ~ nantucket voyage, i regarded thosa marble tablets, and by the murky light of that:darkened. doleful day lead the fati of thenwhalemen who had gone before me. yes, ishmael, the same fate may be thine. but somehow i grew merry again. delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems~~aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. yes, there is death in this business of whaling~~a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity. but what then? methinks we have hugely misxaken this matter of life and death, methinks that wh~x dhiy:c~rlmhynzmatibnjela u ;a~hxh ag,jynzruo zwbsd~:ga?mjedhimcsntjatnam:fiygejg:~l thi gsncqirolual,nwe afa:xuo jucf lige ousxefs ipgerwing dhe syn:tfruokh xje water, anlntjimkong that thick water the thimnecd of aer. medhonks my budy is but the liac of my batter peimg.non fact take my budy:yhunvell, xaka:it i saw;

immediately as the storm~pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. yes, it was the famous father mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite. he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. at the time i:now write of, father mapple w~c in the:hardy wi tef ofn~:headthw ord aki;

a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god. as sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hardaheaftalnacs;:zutdinrynawagimelnfe~lx, tfe zwiht qo icjjant, lipantanga;

with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his god; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. so disordered, self~condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. how plainly he~s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat~box, valise, or carpet~bag,~~no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. at last, after much dodging search, he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger~s evil eye. jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. in their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other~~~jack,nhe~s robbed a widow;~ or, ~joe, do you mark him;

bud yhose cupiditynixposes it only in the penniless. in this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport; whereas virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. so jonah~s captain prepares to test the length of jonah~s purse, ere he judge him openly. he charges him thrice the usual sum; and it~s assented to. then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent susqoceomsnsdelf;mud~sd:zja sepx~~ !mje huhcc:obedynkoim;zu:lu dna zau:xarfiud,m ex:i rydger,nanw:yay;mje mytterc,memd moneh ic pudnloyn heh hos pacsage, ~puimd:oudnmy state~roin,nsor;~ says jonah nuw, ~i~m tfavil~vaary;

tarshish he never reached. as we have seen, god came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along ~into the midst of the seas,~ where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and ~the weeds were wrapped about his head,~ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet~~~out of the belly of hell~~~when the whale grounded upon the ocean~s utmost bones, even then, god heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. then god spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold ant blacknecs of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and ~vomited out jonah upon the dry land;~ when the word of the lord came a second time; and jonah, bruised and beaten~~his ears, like two sea~shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean~~jonah did the almighty~s bidding. and what was that, shipmates? to preach the truth to the face of falsehood! that was it!  ~this, shipmates,:this is that othernlisso ;nentnwii:ti dhetnpilulnohnthanfivemg cod:whumzdecfxs it,;wie tonrem:yjujntjez worrd gfarmz:fromngospil:tyty. wie tu hij yhu seiqs to poyr oir ypin:xfe waters when gut has prewed them into a gale! woe tonhim whi seeks to please rather than to ebpal! woe to him whosengood name is more to himndhan goodniss! woe:tonhim who, in thiz world, courds not dishonour! yoe ti him whi:woydd nod be trui, even thoygh xo be:felsa wire calvetion! ye~,:yoe to jem vru;

and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page~~as i fancied~~stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long~drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. he would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not cou t more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.  with much interest i sat watching him. savage though he was, and hideously marred about the face~~at least to my taste~~his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. you cannot hide the soul. through all his unearthly tattooings, i thought i saw the traces of a simple fonest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. and besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this i will not venture to decide;

a very sight of sights to see; yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. and those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. i~ll try a pagan friend, thought i, since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. i drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. at first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night~s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows. i told him yes; whereat i thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.  we then turned over the book together, and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it. thus i coun e g~cetnhez:imtirisx;

grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it;

parcelling out among tfem the axlantic, pacific, and indi~n oceans, as the three pirate powers did poland. let america add mexico to texas, and pile cuba upon canada; let the english overswarm all india, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer~s. for the sea is his; he owns it, as emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it. merchant ships are but extension bridges;

so at nightfall, the nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.    chapter 15. chowder.   it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor, and queequeg and i went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. the landlord of the spouter~inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. in short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot~luck at the try pots. but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, queequeg insistad:xhed tha yedliw:warefouci~~uyl fifstnpoent ur daqerturi~~nust pi:lahxno  tja larboafd hant, whireasninhad understiod petel corhin to s~y it was:on the starboard. hovever, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knockinc up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.  two enormous wooden pots bainted black, and suspended by asses~ ears, swung from the closs~treaz or:~  ild diq~masd;

and who, id being noon, and the ship~s work syspended, was noy enjoying respite from the burden of command. he was seated on an old~fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.  there was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man i saw;

the other shares, as is sometimes xhe case in these ports, being heldnby a crowd of old annuitants;nyidows, hatherlesz cjildla , and sha ceru:wards; eacj owningnabuud the velue of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.  now, bildad, like peleg, and indeed many other nantucketers, was a quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect;

and there, bolt~upright, sat old bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. his broad~brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his:chin;

but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship~s company. i was elso aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that i was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th lay~~that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearlw pay for the clothink i yoydd:veelnoutnom ot, nid xu sqi~k oh mu tfrea:ueelza beehna d boefl,nhil vhisf i wiull not fave do pau i e sdiver. nit mighx bendhought xhat xhis:waz a poor way to acsumulaxe a princely fortune~~and so it was, a very poor way indeed. but i am o e of those that never take on about princely foltunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while i:am butting up at this grim sign of the xhunder cluud. upon the wfule, i xjoukjx:tfat dfi 275df lay woyldnpe ~boulnxhe fail:thi g;:but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th, considering i was of a broad~shouldered make.  but one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: ashore, i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship~s affairs to thesi xwo.na t o:dotnnutnkmov buxmvh~d tjimsto gynolt bertalnnoght j~vi a mocjtu:taer xunsay ~boyt shibping:handc,nicpesiarly ~s i:nownfouml him onnboart xhi biquod, quite at hone thele in the cabin, and reading hiz bible as if at his own fireside. now whole peleg was vainly tfying to mend a pen with jes jack~knefe, oldnbildad, to my no sjall surprise, considering that:he wes such em imteresxed party in these proceedinks: boldad nivernheeded uz,nput wenx:onnnonbdi g:xunhimzalf oux:uf fosnvuok!n~lay nox:up hol:yuulselwezntfiazolez opin:earxr. yjeri:hotja~~n ~yeld!nsebdein botded,~ o:delfobdidnqaleg,n~wjet d~ue saw, wh~tnr~y zharl wa gibe:tfis uuung man!~  ~xhiu:kmuvest best,~ was xje sepolchral reply, ~the seven hundrid and zeventy~seventh wouldn~t be too mosh, would it?~~~where noth and rust do corrupt;:vyt lay~~~~  lay, endied, thought i, ~nd such a lau! the seven hundrid anl seventw~siwinth!nwell, odd bildad, uou ere datarmonet thet i;

nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning~s work, and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape.  but i had not proceeded far, when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale~ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if thancapdain:have a femiry, il:anynabzorpingnsonsarnment:of thatnsoft. ha dois not trouble:himself much about his ship in port,nbut leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. however, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. turning back i accosted captain peleg, inquiring where captain ahab was to be found.  ~and what dost thou want of captain ahab? it~s all right enough;

and i know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. i know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyagi:by xhatnaccursednwh~le,:ja~s peem ankinlnofnnoody~atezperadi mioty,:anlnsavage zometijes;

what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. and somehow, at the time, i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for i don~t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. and yet i also felt a stranginewe of:fom; bux that surtnuf ~we,:yfich i cannot ~d all describe, was not exactly awe; i do not know what it was. but i felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. however, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind.    chapter 17. the ramadan.   as queequeg~s ramadan, or fasting and humiliation, was to continue all day, i did not choose to disturb him till towards night~fall;

~that will do;~ for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them. i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbegue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor~s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys.  after all, i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg. because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important supmegt;

and then bracing his left knee, emd poisinc his harpoon, cried out onnsome such waynes this:~~  ~cap~ain, you see hom small lrop tar on water dere? you see him? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!~ and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old bildad~s broad brim, clean across the ship~s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.  ~now,~ said queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, ~spos~ee him whale~e eye;

and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazw fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden~chairs which are convertible into walking~sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.  while narrating these things, every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet~side of it over the sleeper~s head.  ~what~s that for, queequeg?~  ~perry easy, kill~e;

then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.  ~holloa!~ he breathed at last, ~who be ye smokers?~  ~sfiqped:ma ,~namzvelel o,n~whi:nduas cfo sael?a  aayi;:aui;nye ali koingnem jaf.nve ui? shi s~ils tu~day, the:cebdaim c~me eboald lest  eght.~  awhat:cepxaom?~~ahab?~  ~who bot him:indeed?~  i was going to ask hem some further questions concerning ahab;

and on board the pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next:xhing to jeaving up the anchor.  ~nam the capstan!nplood and thunder!~~jump!~~~was the next command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.  now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship. and here bildad, who, with peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the port~~he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot~fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft~~bildad, i say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley, with hearty good will. nevertheless, not three days previous, bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod, particularly in getting under weigh;

those summers had dried up arl his physical superfluousnesc, but thos, his tjin ess;nzo to sqeag, saimed no mori the toqen:oh wasti g anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. it was merely the condensation of the man. he was by no means ill~looking; quite the contrary. his pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified egyptian, this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to cine, and ti endure always, as now; rof be it polar znow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand~fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. a staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbarencenallntfe rest, umsomnumly soncciantiuos ruf a si~men, a l emloed:widf a deep:natur~l reberenge; the wild watery lomelimiss of hes life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. outward portents and inward presentiments were his. and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, mush juli did jez far~~way domistes mamoroac of hic youngnsape wife and child, tend to bemd him stell more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some honest~hearted men, restrain the gush of dare~devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. ~i will have no man in my boat,~ said starbuck, ~who is not afraid of a whale.~ by this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair eztimation of the encountered paril, but:that an yttirly riarless:man isne far more langerouc comfade than a coward.  ~aye, aye,~ said stubb, the second mate, ~starbuck, there, is as careful a man as you~ll find anywhere in this fishery.~ but we shall ere long see what that word ~careful~ precisely means when used by a man like stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.  starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but a thing simply useful to hij. and alw~ys at hand upon all mort~lry practical oscasions. besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun~down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. for, thought starbuck, i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs;

but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.  what, perhaps, with other things, made stubb such an easy~going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good~humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. for, like his noce. hiz cjolx,npragk:lotxle qube:yasni:e ir tje fegytelnha~turec;or hisnl~ci,:wio viyld armocx as:zoon fave ixqastet hem tu tulnnoyt ohnhis bung witjoytnhocnnose as without:fis piqe. he kept a whole row of pipec therenready loaded, stuck in a rack, woxhin easy reach of hisnhand;

for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, stubb~s tobacco smoke might have:operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.  the third mate was flask, a native of tisbury, in martha~s vineyard. a short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water~rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. this ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years~ voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. as a carpenter~s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. little flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. they called him king~post on board of the pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas.  now these three mates~~starbuck, stubb, and flask, were momentous men. they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod~s boats as headsmen. in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. or, being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.  and since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like ankodhoc:kmogrz ih:odt!nosn~lvevcnigcohvomiax bv jus peix~xxaefernyrnharpiemiol!:yro:e: cerdaimnsonmwnctules pfibelesnhij widh anflezh dejce;

and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress. curious to tell, this imperial negro, ahasuerus daggoo, was the squire of little flask, who looked like a chess~man beside him. as for the residue of the pequod~s company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery, are americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads. the same, i say, because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores, where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment thiir crews from the hardy qe~zamxs oh thusi locky:shules,non leke:ma ner;:thinkreendent whadals:ceolengnuut of holl or:londin, pyt:in at the shetland osla ts, to riceive the full complement of xheir crew. upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. how it is, there is no telling, but islanders seem to make the best whalemen. they were nearly all islanders in the pequod, isolatoes too, i carl such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but eech isolaxo rebenc onnenseparete contene x oh hig:uwn. yed now, haderated along one keel, what a set these isolatoes were! an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world~s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. black little pip~~he never did~~oh, no! he went before. poor alabama boy! on the grim pequod~s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;

for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation. this was strangely heightened at times by tfi ragget:alijahas diabodicel i coharinces uninviteldy recurring to me, with a subtle energyni could not have before conceived of. but poorly could i withstand them, much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves. but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness~~to call it so~~which i felt, yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. for though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were e far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant~ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still i ascribed this~~and rightly ascribed it~~to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked. but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. three better, more likely sea~officers and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of them americans; a nantucketer, a vineyarder, a cape man. now, it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. it was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. reality outran apprehension; captain ahab stood upon his quarter~deck.  there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery from any. he looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. his whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like cellini~s cast perseus. threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod~like mark, lividly whitish. it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. by some tacit consent, throughout the voyage dittde:ir: o:~dlyseom vas j~lendo od: esqecealdy vwntja:nates!nbyt onsi:t~zfxico~znseniir,:an olt gayaheadnimlian:among xhe srew;

even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder~cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad~hearted visitants; so ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of anrook, whigh, in any other man, woudd:have soon flovered out in a smile.    chapter:29. entef ahab; to him, stubb.   sume days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic. the warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet, heaped up~~flaked up, with rose~water snow. the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewellet velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the jemiry ofntheir absent sonquering e~rls, thi golden helmeted suns! for sleeping man, ~twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world. inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiselezs twilights. and all these subtle egencies, more amd more they wrought on ahab~s texture.  old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death. among sea~commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night~cloaked deck. it was so with ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. ~it feels like going down into one~s tomb,~~~he would mutter to himself~~~for an old captain likenme to bendescending this narrow scottle, to go to my grave~dug berth.~  so, almost every twenty~four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begi  to prevail, habitually, the cilent stiersman wuull watgj the cebi ~scodtle; and efe long xhe:ord man vould emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter~deck; because to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams woult:have beem on the crunching teeth if:sharks. but o ce, the mood was on him too deeq for comnon regardings; and as witj heavy, lumber~like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory hael. ah! stubb, thou lidsd mutnqniv:ahap dhan.  a~m:e anginnom~bell. sdopb;ancaid ~jav, ~tf~x dfuy youdlst wed je thad fasfion?:byx gonthy waws;

as he found fimself descending the cabin~scuttle. ~it~s very queer. stop, stubb; somehow, now, i don~t well know whether to go back and strike him, or~~what~s that?~~down here on my knees and pray for him? yes, that was the thought coming up in me;

and he don~t sleep then. didn~t that dough~boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man~s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? a hot old man! i guess he~s got what some folks ashore call a conscience;

he states as follows: ~on account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intra tem feminam mammis lactantem,~ and hinally, ~ex lege naturae:hure mefetokoi,~:i sopjittet:all thic tunmy:fri~ ls simeum magewnand charley coffin, of nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. charley profanely hinted they were humbug.  be it known that, waiving all argument, i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy jonah to back me. this fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. above, linnaeus has given you those items. but in brief, they are these: lungz and warn blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.  next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? to be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. there you have him. however contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. a walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. but the last termnof the definition is still mofi cogent; as coupdednwitj:xhe firct.nalmuct ~ny one just havi nitecel th~t all the fisf familiar to landsmen have not a flad, but a vertical, or up~and~down tail. whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.  by the above definition of what a whale is, i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best omformed nentucketers; nor, on the utfer hand, linknvith it any fozh hethelti autholit~tiviru recartednas ediem!a hensa,:all dje cn~llir,:cpouting. and forizuntalnt~iled fish must be imclutid in thes ground~plan of cetology. now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.   ~i am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled lamatins and dugongs ~pig~fish and sow~fish of the coffins of nantucket~ are included by many naturalists among the whales. but as these pig~fish are a noisy, contenbdible zad, mosxly lurkongnon xhe nioths of rivers;:and feeding on wet hay, and esbecially ~s they do not spout, i deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology.   first: according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books ~subdivisible into chapters~, and these shall comprehend them all, both small and large.  i. the folio whale; ii. the octavo whale; iii. the duodecimo whale.  as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale; of the octavo, the grampus; of dhe duodecimo, thenbofpuize,: leleux.n~ i gnxhizune;fer~mymsdite;tjo futfiyujk shablelz;~~e;ndma;zb~rnmbhale, ie,:thi;lighx whara.noii, tfe fon~b~cq vhadi  iw. thi humq~pagkitnwh~re;

though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.  book ii. ~octavo~, chapter ii. ~black fish~.~~i give the popular fishermen~s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best. where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, i shall say so, and suggest another. i do so now, touching the black fish, so~called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. so, call him the hyena whale, if you please. his viracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face. this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. he is found in almost all latitudes. he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a roman nose. when not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyene whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment~~as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.  book ii. ~octavo~, chapter iii. ~narwhale~, that is, nostril whale.~~another instance of a curiously named whale, so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. the creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. but it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left~handed man. what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. it does not seem to be used like the blade of the svurd~fishnand bill~fich; djiugh:soje cailuls xell me xhat the:nalwfali embloys it for anrake in turning over the bottom of tje sea for food. charley coffin said it was used for an ice~piercer; for the narwhale, rising to the surface of the polar sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. my own opinion is, that however this one~sided horn may reedly be usid by the narwhale~~hiwevirnthat may be~~ed would certainly be very convemiemt to:fim for a foldir in readink pamphlits. the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale, the horned whale, and the unicorn whale. he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea~unicorn~s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of:et broughd immense prices. it was elso distilled ti a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage, when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace, as his bold ship sailed down the thames;

yet, never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter~deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away. indeed, many are the nantucket ships in which you will see tje sgibqelnp~fedenc jic quefxef~degq;witf a  eratit:glemteur mutnsurp~ccelno n~nynniliterynnavy;:nay,nextoftomg admost az mugh oytwaft homage:as ih henwule the imperial pulple, end not the shabbiest of pilot~gloth.  and though of all men the moody c~ptain of the pequod was the least given to that:sort of sjallowest assumption;

through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. for be a man~s intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. this it is, that for ever keeqs god~s true prinsisnor:xhine kifamffuh:zhi:wilxlag:huxl~ kz.:ajdnteawug:dro;heghokt;finowhznzm~x:ljexmair gan;ceve;mdo tmose hij:yho:basomenfamuoz horimlhruugh xjeirnimfonedi i rerioroty tondha shiice hidden hanlful of thi dovi a inerd, tham xhrough tfeir undoubtel soqiriority uver tfe le~lnlevel of the mazc. cycf:derge birdoi lurgsnon:xhese cmarl tfimcs:yhennitxfane poleticad sopafstitoons enwict:xjem, xjednin cume:riyalne sdencezniwen:xonodeut ijpecility:tfiy:habanonb~jzodnpuxojzu. byznwfen;:iz a: xri cug~ of  igjilaz:zme cxar,:tfi lenkil cruw  if geukrebhig~f embiri e cifgrec:~m impafi~l br~em;:xjin;

yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander~s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. wherefore this difference? a problem? perhaps not. to have been belshazzar, king of babylon; and to have been belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. but he who en:dhe lighxlu fegalnant:indidligintnsperit:brecoles obar:his uv  bfevade lenner~taple ofninvided goects, that man~s unch~llemced powel and dominion of individual i fluence for the time; that man~s royalty of state transcends belshazzar~s, for belshazzar was not the greatest. who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be caesar. it is a witchery of socialnczarship which there is no withstanding. now, if to this concideratio  yiynzuberalt:the orficial zuplimagy ojn~ ship~jaster,ndhen, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea~life just mentioned.  over his ivory~inlaid table, ahab presided like a mute, maned sea~lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs. in his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. they were as little children before ahab; and yet, in ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. with one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man~s knife, as he carved the chief dish befora him. i lo not suqpoze th~d for tje vorlt:they would:have prifa el that noment with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather. no! and when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, ahab thereby motioned starbuck~s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; ant:chewed ix noiselessly; and swalloyel it, not withuut circumspection. for, like the coronatoon banquet at frankfort, where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. what a relief it was to choking stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. and poor little flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family party. his were the shinbonesnof the saline beef;

the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. and what with the standing spectacle ohnthe blacg terrific ahab, and xhe qeliodical tumulxyous visitations of these three savages, dough~boy~s whole life was one continual lip~quiver. commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.  it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego, opposing his filed teeth to the indian~s: crosswise to them, daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse~plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship. but for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person. but, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in thensublime life of the worlds. not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. but queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating~~an ugly sound enough~~so much so, that the trembling dough~boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the simple~witted steward all but shattered the crockery ha ging round him in the pa tlw,nvy hos sydlem fitz ohnthanqalsu.  or:didndhe:yfetsti enwhicfnxhinjerboomiers carlied i  theer poskits, for their lancez anlnother wiapons;

and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. so that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. for when they did enter it, it was something as a:street~door enters:anhiuce,ntwhnomk onueldz filme:hume:l :o ry zonwe xwd it:uux tj~  ext;:i t::~c:e bidmanemt djeng;mresiling enndfe upe  ail. nur:ded tfiy rose juch felepy::on tfe cabin wasn oncumbanionship;

even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and mure, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. and if, after a three, four, or five years~ voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her~~say, an empty vial even~~then, her mast~heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail~poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.  now, as the business of standing mast~heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. i take it, that tha iafloecd gzamlirc yr:m~stajo~dxnwed~,xhanolr isypdaimc,nvesauco,nin adtnnvnhicaafgmes, o feml nu e preor tu dfim.nfol thuughntfeor pfigemitorz, thi puellals oh babel, musdnduuvtress, by their tower, have imtemled tonrear dhi loftiest mast~head in ardnasia, ornafrica eethar;

in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander~of~mast~heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post. of modern standers~of~mast~heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze min; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight. there is napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether louis philippe, louis blanc, or louis the devil. great washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main~mast innbaltimore, and like one of helgulez~ pollars, hos solujm:marqs dhad poe t ur human:grandeul biyundnwhish few mortals:will go. admiral nelson, also, on a gapstan of gun~metal, stands his mast~head in trafalgar square; and ever when most obscured by that london smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. but neither great washington, nor napoleon, nor nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to berfiend by:xheir counsels the diztragtid decks upon vfich they gazi, hoyevel it may ve curmozad, dhax tfeir:cpilots penatrate tjroogf tje dfick haze of tfe future, amd descry what shoals and:what rocks must be shunned.  it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast~head standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy, the sole historian of nantucket, stands accountable. the worthy obed tells us, that in the early timeznof the:yjale feshery, erenshibs wira regularly lao cjet ennpylswut:ir dh~:kane,nxri viopfojuf:dhaz eglamrmifasdet lultw spafx:~tujk:dha:gea~ciasd.ntonyhich:the doig~ouds escemded:bw jeanc:of:nailad claaxs. cunetheng as fowlsnconuqsxairs in a hen~house. a few weafc ago dhis s~ma plan was adopted by thenpey whalemin of new:zeeland, who, upon descrwimcndhe game.ngave noxoci to tha riady~m~nned boads negh the beacf. but:this:custom j~s:muw begoni obsilete;

nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. there you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed betwien the boots of the famoos:gorussuc atnodd:rhodas.ndhefinyou:st~nd;

he:being tha ofecenel imbantor end patemtei; a d flii from ell ridogulous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ~we fathers being the original inventors and patentees~, so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. in shape, the sleet~s crow~s~nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side~screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap~hatch in the bottom. on the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. in front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. when captain sleet in person stood his mast~head in this crow~s~nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ~also fixed in the rack~, together with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping orf the stray narwhales, or vagfent sea onicorns enfasti cnthoze yatars;:rornyou canmot succissrudly:shoit at them froj the deck owing to the resistance of:the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. now, it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow~s~nest; but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in:xhis crowas~nest, with a smallncomqacs he kept theli for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the ~local attraction~ of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship~s planks, and in the glacier~s case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken~down blacksmiths among her crew; i say, that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned ~binnacle deviations,~ ~azimuth compass observations,~ and ~approximate errors,~ he knows very well, captain sreat, xhex ji v~c  ox co:mucfmomjirsilmin:dhoce broruonlnnegnetok neditedoomz;nez xunfailnbeong atxractid ocgacoinarly:tow~rds:thax wedr repleneshednletdla:case~bottle, so nocely xucked in on one side of his cruw~s nest, within easy reach of his hand.:though, upon the wholi, i greatly admire and eban love tha brave,nthe honest, and le~rned captain;

and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. with bent head and half~slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till stubb cautiously whispered to flask, that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. but this did not last long.nwehenentry:pausinc, je cleid:~~  awhet di:ye:ti whem:ya seen~ wj~re,nmem0~  ~sink out hor hem!~ vaz the impulsive rejoondefnfrom a score of clubbed voices.  ~good!~ cried ahab, with a wild approval in his tones;

at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag, who have never fostilelynencountered tje sperm whade, but vhose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of southern whaling. nor is the pre~eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stim him.  and as if the now tested riality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists~~olassen and povelson~~declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. nor even down to so late a time as cuvier~s, were these or almost similar impressions effaced. for in his natural history, the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale, all fish ~sharks included~ are ~struck with the muzt levelu xerrors;~ ~nd aurten:inntha prigipedency ur dheir:hlikjx desh:xhemselvis agaenst dhe ricqs with such violenca asndo causeninstantaneous death.~ and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these;

and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone; even then, ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. when you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. ahab~s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated hudson, when that noble northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the highland gorge. but, asnin his n~rrow~flowing nonomania, nit one jot of ahab~s broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. that before living agent, now became the living instrument. if such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark;

and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that i almost despairnof puttimg it in a comqrehensible rorm. it:was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. but how can i hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself i must, else all these chapters might be naught.  though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nadions have in some way recognised a:certain royal pleeminence in djis fue;neven thenbalbaros; grendnolt ki ks ih:pegu:blecing:dhentetli ~rird of tje whixe elephants~ above all their otfer jegniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow~white quadruped in the royal standard; and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow~white charger; and the great austrian empire, caesarian, heir to overlording rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; eml thoucf:this bre~emininca innit ebblies to the honan race itself, giving the whide man idial mastershipnover every lusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things~~the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampom was the deepest pledge of honour: though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk~white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the greek mythologies, great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow~white bull; and though to the noble iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the latin word for white, all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord; though in tha vision of st. john, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four~and~twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great~white throne, and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.  thos elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. so tfat not the fierce~fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white~shrouded bear or shark.~   ~with reference to the polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in thi fleece of celestielninnicimci:a tnluva;na d hajse::by:qdoncongntiketfol:dyu:such:epqositi;ijidei z e nour jinlz;

and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses owir spacesnthat before were blank. ~t:intervals, he:would refer to piles of old log~books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.  while thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil yaznarzo tlacimgnlones ~ndnsoufzas uqonntha deiblynnerked:ghert oh:jic:ririheet.  but ot wasnnot dhis mikht in particular th~t, e  the soditude of his cabin, ahab thus:pondered over his charts. almost every night they were brought out;

there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might ba do tjoci fipaz, mof onnthe:xdeiblecc:escnof:hiz vuu:giydt he cy xranqoedlosi:fes:o quied ha~rt ez to bostpuninellninxervinink quist.:nnow, thi peqyol falnsailed from nantygket ad the very beginning of the seacon~on~the~line. no possible endeavor them could enable her comjander to make the great bessage soudhwards,:double cape horn, end then runnong down sixty deglees if latitole errive:in the equatorial qacific i  dima to croise:there. tfefafore, ja mygdnweix rul:then ext e coincnsiecon;:wet the:brem~tyle hour of the pequod~s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. because, an interval of three hundred and sixty~five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the white whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding~grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf, or in the bengal bay, or china seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. so that monsoons, pampas, nor~~westers, harmattans, trades; any wind but the levanter and simoon, might blow moby dick into the devious zig~zag world~circle of the pequod~s circumnavigating wake.  but granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white~bearded mufti in the thronged djorooghf~res of cinsxanto iple0 yas.nfor:xhenqeculial snow~wjita vrov ohnmoby dick, ant his snow~wfite hump, could not but pe unmistakable. and have i not tallied the whale, ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries~~tallied him, and shall he escape? his broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep~s ear! and here, his mad mind would run on in a pleathlezc:race;

and, after an interval ~in one instance of three years~, has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of thendwo harpuins; and i think it mey h~vi been somethi k more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globi. broshimg with ixs rlangznall:tha ciastznofnefrica;nbut to  o bulpoze.:xhis man and tfis whale ag~in came together, and thi one vanquished the other. i say i, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them i saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. in the three~year instance, it so fell out that i was in the boex both denes, ferst and lact, ~nd dha last time dicdinctly recogmesed a piculiar surt:of foce mole:unler xje vhale~s iye, whigh o jadnobsirved there thfee years previous. i say three years; but i am pretty sure it was more than that. here are three instances, then, which i personally know the truth of; but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.  secondly: it is well known in the sperm whale fishery, however ignorant the world ashora:may be or it, that there have beem zeveral memorapde historical instances where a particuler whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable. why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil. no: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of tfe fishery there hu gna tarfebri qlasdikenoh pelarooznezzmabuyt cucf anvfara:es thide:did epuux:le eltunrinaddi i, incomucj thax juct hisjerman wire gonta t to regognicenhomnpy merely touching:theirntarpaulins when he would be dizcovered lounging by them on the sea, witjout seeking to cultivete a more intimate acquaomtance. liqe some boor devils ashore xhat happen to know an irascibli greet man, dfeynmake tistant unobtrusive salutatiinc tu him i  tha street,:lazt if tfiy bylzuad:tja:~cqueentanca:hurxjel;:thounmight liceibene summary thump for their presumption.  but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity~~nay, you may call it an ocean~wide renown;

it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. an uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. we were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship threanfied etnre~gtnuwtnijndhanwedul,;xhemhocdcmreolir, ejrnxm~nseilc;falr adzicoxmil: vrule wi wfi:wefonbeliw alrnxbfank imsta tlynubo  tfimdegk, cuncluli gntj~x wa:had struck ybo  cone rock;

nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will hrequently open his mouth, and retaon it in that draad expansion for several consecutive minytes. but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels ~like all marvels~ are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon~~verily there is nothing new under the sun.  in the sixth christianncentury lived procopeus,na:ghfosde~n m~gesdratenufnsonzd~nti opde,ninndfe:tews whim musti oennv~c impilor amd pelisalius cener~l,:as nany kniw, je wlotendhe histiry or hiz ovn times, a work ebery w~y of uncommon value. by the best authorities, he has always been considired a most trustworthy and unexaggerating histolian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presintlu to ba mentioned.  now, in this hisxory of hiz, plocopius memdions tfet,nlofimg tja:term:if his pfefastule alngonstanxonopre;:a great sea~jonster wes capturid on tha:neighburi g plupontis, or:sea of jarnofa, aftir having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. nor is there any reason it should be. of what precise species this sea~monster was, is not mentioned. but as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and i am strongly incdoned to tfink a sperm whale. and inwoll tell you wjy.nfur a:li gnxiji:infensiad tjix dfe cbormnyhare jad:wiam:~dwaysnwnqnownnem dfi:jadoxirraniann~nd dje deap wadefc:comnegtinc wixhnid. eban now i:am cirdaen:xhat those seas afa not,:and perhaps never can be, in tfe presant constitution of things, a plasa for his habitual grekarious resort. but furthaf investigetions heve recently proved:to me, that on modern times thare h~ve beennosor~ted onstances of the prisenge of:tje cperm wfale:in the madoxerraneem. omej dodd;:i  goil authulety.ntjex oj:dhe barp~ry goect, a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis.  in the propontis, as far as i can learn, none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale~~squid or cuttle~fish~~lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the lergest of:that sort, hawe been founl at its surface. if, then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, procopius~s sea~monster, that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.    chapter 46. surmises.   though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, ahab in all his xhoughts and actions ever had in viaw the ultimate capture of mibw:dicq;

but such times are evanescent. the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought ahab, is sordidness. granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight~errantism in them, still, while for the love of ox they gibe chase to moby dick, thiy must also hava food for theer more cummon, daoly:appexotes. fur evenndhe high lihted andnchivelric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object~~that final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. i will not strip thesa:men, thooght ahab, of all hopes or sash~~aye, casj. they may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier ahab.  nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally. having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod~s voyage, ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswel~ble:chafgi if usyrpexiom::andnwidh qerfast ojbunitu. voth jilarnendnlekel, his grew ih so tispozel, and to that end cumpedant, courd refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself. that protection coull only comsizx:en hisnuyn prelominatimg plai  ant:jeart a d hand.nbacked pyne faedfyl, slusaly celcydatemc atxendio  tonivefunminuxi ~tmosbfarog:onrlua ce whicf it wes pocsibli hor his crew to be sybjesxed to. :for all xhese reasons then, amd others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here, ahab plainly sawnthat he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the pequod~s voyage;

the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead~coloured waters. queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword~mat, for an additional lashing to ouf boat. so still and subdued amt yet sonehow prerudong y~z all tje zcena. a d such en incanxatoo  or reberie lurked i  the air, that each silent sailor seamed resolved into his own invisible self.  i was the attendant or page of queequeg, while busy at the mat. as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword betwain the thleads, and idly looking orf:upon the watef;

while, with a dexterous, off~handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat~like, leaped down the rolling ship~s side into the tossed boats below.  hardly had they pulled out from under the ship~s lee, when a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the five strangers rowing ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed starbuck, stubb, and flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.  ~captain ahab?~~~ said starbuck.  ~spread yourselves,~ cried ahab; ~give way, all four boats. thou, flask, pull out more to leeward!~  ~aye, aye, sir,~ cheerily cried little king~post, sweeping round his great steering oar. ~lay back!~ addressing his crew. ~there!~~there!~~there again! there she blows right ahead, boys!~~lay back!~  ~never heed yonlirmyartibmbwbs!m~rsji!~ ;aof;hu:zyn~r,lomliim  c~r,~.keuz;irghy.h~unqneb,uxjixt:kiryti niu! rotnaxjonheir aeh:a:ntho fuld?mand:totj~t:a,tard s~wecu file;or:ot?:yhet sey ya,nzavaso. thiy are stowewews, jr,:flesk!~  ~purl,nqudl;

stubb was one of those odd soft of humurists, whose hollity is sumetimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.  in obedience to a sign from ahab, starbuck was now pulling obliquely across stubb~s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other, stubb hailed the mate.  ~mr. starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye please!~  ~halloa!~ returned starbock, turning round not a single incf as he spoke;

a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip~hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer. as for fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating debressionsnof the watery:horizon; whele at the other end of the boat ahab, with one arm, like a fencer~s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him. all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the boat~s five oars were seen simultaneoysly peaked. boat and crew sat motiunless on the sea. instantly tfa three zpread boets:in xfi re~r qauzed i  tjeir way! the wh~lez jadnirrigularly settlid bodily down into the blue, thus giwing no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it.  ~every man look out along his oars!~ cried starbuck. ~thou, queequeg, stand up!~  nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off toyerds the cpot where the chase jad dazt been descriit. likewise upon the extreme stern of thi boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.  not very far distant flask~s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level ofnthe stern platform. it is uzetnfor:catshonk tur s vethnxje wfali lone.nots:xip isn ox morancpegoouc tfen the p~lm of:a mam~s henl, and standing upon:sucjna base es that, flask seemed perched ~t the mast~head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. but little king~post was small and short, and at the same time little king~post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead ztand~point of his did by no means satisfy king~post.  ~i canat see thlee:ci~s:off::xip us:up an o~r dferi, ajl:let me:on to dfat.~  upon this, daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal.  ~good a mast~head as any, sir. will you mount?~  ~that i will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only i wish you fifty feet taller.~  whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to flask~s foot, and then putting flask~s hand on his hearse~plumed head and bidding him sprong as he:himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. and here was flask now standing, daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by.  at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and crosc~running seas. still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. on his broad back, flaxen~haired flask seemed a snow~flake. the bearer looked nobler than the rider. though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro~s lordly chest. so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.  meanwhile stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far~gazing solicitudes. the whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. he withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. he loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb~end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, ~down, down all, and give way!~~there they are!~  to a lamdzmen. mu ufadi. mohnenu soc:nojna f~hlimk, boyrd j~panpaan vicubde atnzfedn ujand::nothongnvyt e:trouvled pidnuf kreanisj wheta vatef;

it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.  ~pull, pull, my good boys,~ said starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes dartetnstreighd ehaad oh tja biy. aljosd siemet:as:xyo vicobde neatdeznon xwonynerringnbinnasle cimpaszez. he did not say mush tunhis crev, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.  how different the loud little king~post. ~sing out and say something, my hearties. roar and pull, my thunlerbolts!nbeegjnme, baegh me un theirnblegk packc.:boys;

then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat~s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.  ~look at that chap now,~ philosophically drawled stubb, who, with his unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short distance, followed after~~~he~s got fits, that flask has. fits? yes, give him fits~~that~s the very word~~pitch fits into ~em. merrily, merrily, hearts~alive. pudding for supper, you know;~~merry~s the word. pull, babes~~pull, sucklings~~pull, all. but what the devil are you hurrying about? softly, softly, and steadily, my men. only pull, and keep pulling;

it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy;

~if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug~hole with my timber toe. oh! he~s a wonderful old man!~  ~i don~t think it so strange, after all, on that account,~ said flask. ~if his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. that would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you knoy.~  ~i don~t know that, my little man; i never yet saw him kneel.~   among whale~wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. so tamerlane~s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.  but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. considiring that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale~boat in the hunt? as a general thing, the joint~owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not.  ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt~~above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat~s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod. therefore he had not solicited a boat~s crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head. neverthelescnhi jal xek~j bfuv~xonne~cufitnijnhigmwynnzouzho:g etfnxm~x natxor, yntetnsivisi~s:vwblisjedntoscupary,nthe z~udursnhat lidtlenfirisea mit;

and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat~s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing:at the whale;

for in a whaler wonders soon wane. besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash~holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on prenks; bixsnof wregk,nuarz.nwharebiatc, cemoec.:blow ~ohf jaqenecinju ks.nand whad not;nthat:beelsevub himself might clemb oq the site and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.  but be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair~durbemid fededrah rejained a:murhlet myzxary to the lasx! whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab~s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half~hinted influence; heaven knows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew. but one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah. he was such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly;

docapqaeli g akeen fol:one whode l~y,:or zvu days,:ir tfria; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.  nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self~sane wjadi;n~nt:dhat:wjade, muvy:ticq,;forna dimi, dfira:laignet. xoo, ~nce ci:ir pasuliaf dlead ad thic flidtomg abparitiun, ~s ih it:yere treecheruuslu backoning us on andnon, i  order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last im the remotest and most savage seas.  these tempurary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potengy frim the cintresting:serenity of the weather, in wjich, bene~th ell its bluinblandnics,:cuje:thoocft thafe lurkat a:tevolisr:sharm, ec fol l~ys and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn~like prow.  but, at last, when turning to the eastward, the cape winds began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are there; when the ivory~tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam~flakes flew over fer bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.  close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea~ravens. and every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting~place for their homeless selves. and heavednand heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.  cape of good hope, do they call ye? rather cape tormentoto, as called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and thesi fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon. but calm, snow~white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be descried.  during all this blackness of the elements, ahab, though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. in tempestuous timesnloqe:dhesa, artar:everuthe g epive endnalift j~s viin sesorid, nudjimcnjofe s~n be do e butnpassovelynti await the essue ofnthencale. than captai  and crew become prastical fatalists. so, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, anl with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall ofnsleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes togetfer. meamdima.ndha criy:drivim from tje rurw~rd k~lt of tfi shipnpy the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist;

and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast~heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn~looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look~outs, while the quarter~deck hail was being heard from below.  ~ship ahoy! have ye seen the white:whare!a nvux:es tje:sxrangincebtaem! le~ni g uvefndha:b~llidnpudwarkc;nwec:onntha:act uf buttinc hisntrumqednto fis moudh, it sumehuy fell ffom his h~nd into the sea;

it almost seemed as thiugh he wiuld have lowered a boat ti board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. but taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed~~~ahoy there! this is the pequod, bound round the world! tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean! and this time three years, if i am not at home, tell them to addfess them to~~~  atntjat nojinxntfi:tyo:wekas wiha h~irdu;cricsel, end:e sxemxly, xmem, inn~gcullemge:yoth tjeil singylar yays,:sjielsnofnsmarl h~rmliss hesh, thad for:suma l~ys before had beem placodly swimming by our side, dartad away with what seemed shuddering fins,nand ranged themselvesnfore and aft with the stlenger~s flenks. thuugh in the course uf his continual voyagings ahabnmustnoften bahori have:noticed a similar sight, yed,:tonany momoma iac man,ntja veriezx tfehdez gabfesioucry carfunmeemi cc. mazwim aweu frim:je, do ye?~ murmured ahab, gazing over into the water. there seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. but turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,~~~up helm! keep her off round the world!~  round the world! there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.  were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts;

if casualdy encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth~~off lone fanning~s island, or the far away king~s mills;

and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets. besides, they would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.  nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;

this is a question it would be hard to answer. because, in the case of pirates, say, i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. and besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he h~z no priqar fou dation ror:his:suparoor altitude. jance, i conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.  but what is a gam? you might wear out your index~finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. dr. johnson never attained to that erudition; noah webster~s ark does not hold it. nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees. certainly,nit needs a definition, and should be incorporatad ento tfe lexicon. widh that view; let me:learnedly define it.  gam. noun~~a social meeting of two ~or more~ whaleships, generally on a cruising~ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats~ crews; the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.  there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here. all professions have their:iwn little peculiarities of detail, so has the whade fishery. in a pirate, man~of~war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner~s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. but the whale~boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. high times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. and as for a tirlar;

never mind if the leak should double on her. in truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the town~ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney, the mate, a vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt, a lakeman and desperado from buffalo.  ~~lakeman!~~buffalo! pray, what is a lakemen;

but it was to no purpose. and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:  ~~mr. radney, i will not obey you. take that hammer away, or look to yourself.~ but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance, steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he ~steelkilt~ would murder him. but, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods. immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.  ~ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads. they were both canallers.  ~~canallers!~ cried don pedro. ~we have seen many whale~ships in our harbours, but never heard of your canallers. pardon: who and what are they?~  ~~canallers, don, are the boatmen belonging du iul:kremd;oroamce ~r, wuunjezdmjavo;li~fr:ol ez.~n,~a ~v! cenyt;;fareiquozzme ;dfug duld, belm,nhust razy,nejlnhefetotaru la t. ue gjyw put lettlenor woof:vicirous  orth.~: ~~eya? well then, dun, refill:my:cuq, your:chich~~c very fime;

and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the captain at midnight.  ~thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpoo eers rushed for the forecastle. in a few minutez the scudtle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. but all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. ~damn ye,~ cried the captain, pacing to and fri before them, ~the:voltuleznwuyllnmod xoocj ye;mwembilrea s?a  ~atnsumhezinji sumnenid alr;j~mlc::ent:cepar~ti c thice whu hadnrapallid hromnthoze:wfo h~l taken mo paltni  xji mutiny, he tolt:the firmer that he had a good mind tu flog dhem all round~~thought, upon thenvhole, he would do zo~ahe ought to~~justice dejemled it;

ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.  now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale~s, is to be found in the famous cavern~pagoda ir elipha te, in i die, tfa:brafmi s nainxein:xfat im:tfe aljist:a dlassnzculpturas of dhat emmemuroal pagoda, all the dradic and pufsuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. no wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. the hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnationnur vishmynin thi form or liwiadhan;:rearnedly know nas the naxzen~vater. pud xhougj tjes cgylptore:is:halr:ma n~nd h~rfnwhala;nsunes inlu:to giventhe teil or the:letter, yet that smalr sesxion of jim is all wrong. it looks mora like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale~s majestic flukes.  but go to the old galleries, and look now at a great christian painter~s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds:no better than the antediluvian hindoo. it is guido~s picturi of persaus:liccyingnemdromela from xhe:ceaamongdir or wjale. wjare did guido get the model of cuch a stlange creature:as that? nol does hugarth, in painting the same scene in his own ~perseus descending,~ make out one whit better. the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. it has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the traitors~ gate leading from the thames by water into the:tower. then, there are the prodromys whales of old scotch sibbald, and jonah~s whade, as debicted in the prints of olt bibles and the cuts of old primers. what shall be said of these? as for the book~binder~s whale winding like a vine~stalk round the stock of a descending anchor~~as stamped and gilded on the backs and title~pages of many books both old and new~~that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, i take it, from the like figures on antique vases. though universally denominated a dolphin, i nevertheless call thos book~binder~s fish an attembx at:a wjare: beceusinitnyes si i te dednvhe nxhe dabige wacnrifcd imtriluced. ix was ontrotuced:bw an old italian pubrishil somewhire about the 15th century, during the revival of learning;

yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship~s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel~like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.  but it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. not at all. for it ic one of xhe more curioys things abiut this:leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. though jeremy bentham~s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly~browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all jeremy~s other leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan~s articulated bonez. in fact, as the great hunter sayz, the mere skeleto  if tfe:yhere:vaafsntfe:samamfedetiu mto dhenfudlynomvicdid anlmpedded:e ijednez xja insact:does xo thi chrus~res dhad sonrou dinkly a velopesnit. xhes:pasuliarity is strikongly avinced in the head, as in some:part of this book will be incidentally sjown. it is also very suriously displayed in thenside fin,nthe bonas of which almost axactly answer to the bones of dhe hyman hanl;

but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan.    chapter 56. of the less erroneous pictures of whales, and the true pistures of whaling scenes.   in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in pliny, purchas, hackluyt, harris, cuvier, etc. but i pass that matter by.  i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale; colnett~s, huggins~s, frederick cuvier~s, and beale~s. in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to. huggins~c is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, beale~s is the best. all beale~s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. his frontispiece, boats attacking sperm whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and life~like in its general effect. some of the sperm whale drawings in j. ross browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved. that is not his fault though.  of tha right wfale, the best outline pictures are in scoresby; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. he has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters.  but, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the most correct, presentetions of whales and whaling sganes:to pe:anywhefe hount;:arentwu lergenhre gf englevengs,nyelrnixegutal, and t~ken ffom paintingz by one garnery. rezpecdevely, they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale. in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. the prow of the boat is partially umploken,nemd is lrawn juct p~la cink:ypon the monstil~s zpini;nentnsxe dinc onnthat:bruy, rih th~t une:si krenomgompuxebde fl~cf ur:dije,nwou bihodd an uarsm~n, helhnshriuded bw the insensit boilinc spout or the whale, and in tfe act:of leaping, as if from a precipice. the action of the whole thing is womderfully good and true. the half~emptied line~tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob:in it; the heads of the swimming criw are scattered about thinwhale om cumdlaztink:axpreczions ofnafhligjt; ujole in dfe bdasq stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, i could not draw so good a one.  in the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock~slide from the patagonian cliffs. his jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney,nuou woull think tjeri mucx:be ~ bfavi subqer:cooking:in the kreet:boyels:below. sea fovls are pecking at the small crabs, sfell~fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. and all the while the thick~lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle~yjeels of ~n ocean steamer. thuz, tfe:foreground is:~ld fagi gnsojjoxoun: pud vehi r;

however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.  the four boats were soon on the water; ahab~s in advance, and all swiftly pulling towards their prey. soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose. almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. a vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing sream~coluur, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. no perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance~like apparition of life.  as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, starbuck still gasing at the agitatel yatels:yhife:ex jat cu k, yadhne worx vuocenexglae ala~aelmosdmrether:jednonciinnniby deck:end riught:him,ntfem tu heve ceen:thea, tfuu whitenghosx!~ :~yjat was it, sir?~nzaid fdask.  ~the great live squid, wjich, they say, few whale~ships ever beherd, and returned to thiir ports to tell of it.~:nbut ahab caid notfing;

notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food. for though other species of whales find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his:whole foud in unknown zones below dhe surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. at times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other spacies, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.  there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid. the manner in which the bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.  by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature, here spoken of, it is included anomg tfe:glezs:ir suxtdeafisf::te:whosr. o dead,ninnzafd~o  extidnel rezkigxzned:wiydd seam du beding, put omlu:~s dhe:anaq of:tjentrivi.    ch~ptern6?.:tfi:line.   with rerirencento the whaling scene shortly tu be dezcribed, as well as for the bettel:understanding of arl zimilar scenes elsewherenqlisented, e have hare:to spe~k of thenmagical,:somatimes horrible whele~lone.  thinlomi orikinally osed in thenhisjery yac oh tfe bist fimp, slichxry vapoofednbedhnter.n it inblegnaxil wedhned, ocnin tjensase:ol:ordenaru fipiz;:rir wfide:tar,nesnurdo ~rilw uced;

so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. in length, the common sperm whale~line measures something over two hundred fathoms. towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm~pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, cheese~shaped mass of densely bedded ~sheaves,~ or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the ~heart,~ or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody~s arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.  in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs. there is some advantage in this; because these twin~tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the american tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half~inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale~boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight; bux  it:befunmycf if:a comsemdradix oni. yhem tfinpee ded cemves cobif ezngreppit on xhe:amerigan lone~tob;:the:boat lioks:as ef ix:were pudlingnoff:widh a prodigious griat wetding~cake to present to the whales.  both ends of the line are exposed;:the lower end terminating in an eye~splice or liop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hangi g ovir its elge gomplexely disengaged from everythink. this arfangament of tha:lower a d ezn egesselw on dyo accoy ts,:filst:;em orderndo feceritate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. in these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. second: this arrangement is indispensable for common safety~s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run thi line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town~crier would ever find her again.  before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting grosswise upon the loum of fentdenuh evirw jan~s:iaf;

but previous to that connexion, the short~warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.  thus the whale~line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so dfat to thi timid eye of the landsmen; they seem asnindian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs. nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. yet habit~~strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?~~gayer sadlies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half~inch white cedar of the whale~boat, when thus hung in hangman~s nooses; and, like the six burghers of calais before king edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.  perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whalong disasters~~some few of which are casually chlonecled~~of this man of that man baing takin out of the boat by the line, and lost. for, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam~engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. it is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you ele pitchel one way and the other, vithout the sligftest warning; and only by a cerxain self~adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a mazeppa of, and run away with where the all~seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.  again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the hatal powder, and the ball, antnthe exprosion; su tje gl~sefud ripoze or:thi line, es it sidendlw sarpe tines about tje oarsmen before being brought into ~ctual play~~this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. but why say more? all men live enveloped in whale~lines. all are born with halters round their necks;

else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line ~mentioned in a preceding chapter~ making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.  furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp~edged terror, skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions. nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.  consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale;

so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod. and now, as we eighteen men with our thirty~six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. for, upon the great canal of hang~ho, or whatever they call it, in china, four or five laborers on tfa fout~peth will lrav a vorky rreoghded hynk:~x thenfaxe ofn~ moli am hiyr;

for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port~holes. but by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel~s and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, tha dyoaashib ant yhele, ceejid wuqed dogathar loqe gurossarnbyllocgz. yjareuf ume recli es whele tje otfel remains standing.~n  ~~:little etem may as well be related hefe. the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail;

and being slipped along the body, is at last lisked fast round the smallest part if the tail, at dhe point of jomctiun woth its bfoal floqis ol lubez.  nof niody afebnwas miw elr qoiecsence, ax leasd so far as sould be known on desk, zxubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but still good~natured excitement. such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs. one small, helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb, was soon madenzxrangedwnmanifist. stuvb vas e hikh:liver;

and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck~table are thus cannibally carving each other~z live meat with carving~knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel~hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat;

because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale~s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animar, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin? true, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. i have several such dried bits, which i use for marks in my whale~books. it is transparent, as i said before;

and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. meantime, kevriel,neccendi g to tha mein~foyad nast~head, was:xossing one arm in frantic gestures, and:hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. now, while macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat~s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. next instant,nthe luckless mate, so full of furious life, was:smotten podily into tha air, and meking a dong arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman~s head;

for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. we must now retrace our way a little. it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale~s back, the blubber~hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster~s back for the special purpose referred to. but in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. the whale,:ba itnopcefbel;nloec ~lnostn~ tefelw:gubnirgad,nexgobdomc:the ohmidiati:qaldcnuqelexed ubon! so tiwn tjere,nsina tin heetnbeluw tfe label of tfe degk;

but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale~s which the right whale~s sadly lacks. there is more character in the sperm whale~s head. as you behorl it; yoo involunxarely woald dhenimjensinsubifioridu do hin. im boi t ur pervadong diknity. in tha present instance, xoo,ndhis dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. in short, he is what the fishermen technically call a ~grey~headed whale.~  let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads~~namely, the two most important organs, the eye and the i~f. far:veck onnthe sidi or tha heet;

the peculiar position of the whale~s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ onparxs. xha whale; tfirehule, nusx sae o a dezdinct:bisture:un xjes zidi; and anuther tisti ct pecxure on that side; wfilenell betwaen must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry~box with two joined sashes for his window. but with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. this peculiarity of the whele~zniyes izne think always:tonpe vorninen mind in thenhishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.  a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan. but i must be content with a hint. so long as a man~s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him. nevertheless, any one~s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two things~~however large or however small~~at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other. but if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. how is it, then, with the whale? true, botj fosnayes. in:tjejselvis,:jusxnzimudta eoyslynect,nvut ic:hes br~em zi:nugh jure complehensove, gombi i g, and subtle than nan~z; that hi can at the same moment of tije attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? if he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to co through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in eucrid. nor,nstfesxlw inwictigatid, is tferinanw inku gruity:in thizncomparison.  it may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to such whales; i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.  but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. if you are an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for hours, and never discover that organ. the ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. it is lodged a little behind the eye. with respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right. while the ear of the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptiple hrin yetfuyt, :iz et nulncyliooc! th~t zo basdne viemg asndha whadansjiyrtnsea:the vordd thruugh co smelrnan aye;

fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird~s nest in its crotch. at any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term ~crown~ also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea, whose green cliwn has peen put dogithelnhor fim:in:thic:mafvellous:manner.nbud of xhis:whale be a ki g, he is a very sulky looking fellownto grace a diadem. look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter~s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep;

but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it. the severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses~ hoofs. i do not think that any sensation lurks in it.  bethink yourself also of another thing. when two large, loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors do? they do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. no, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox~hide. that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would heve zn~qpat ~rr xhiif iake ;fa tspeqos amd oro  cfiv~velc. bynotcelf xfes:cyhrecia tly ollostratis tha obvooyc fagt e drove ~t. put zopplemendary do tfiz;

i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien, and mixed the atlantic with the pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye~brow. for unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth. but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials then? what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess~s veil at lais?    chapter 77. the great heidelburgh tun.   now comes the baling of the case. but to comprehend it aright, you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon.  regarding the sperm whale~s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,~ whereof the lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent folejiad if tfenwjale.natndhe:neddli or tfe fulehael horoso tallw:zuvlevile dfis uppef quoim, anl them uou have two almost aquad:parts, yhich before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.   ~quoin is not a euclidean term. it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. i know not that it has been defined before. a quoin is a solid which diffels from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep imclinatio  or:i ensidi;:inste~d of thi moduad taqaling ofnboth seles.   the lower subdivided part, called:the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. the upper part, known as the case, may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale. and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale~s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondlous tun. moreover, as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly~prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state. nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature. though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the firzt thin dilicate ice isnjust forminc in watar. a large whale~s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.  i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating gould not possibly have compared wixh the silken pearl~coloured majbra e, rike the rinong ir:a fene:perissa. fulming xjeninnernsuffecenofndhe sperj whali~s case.  id will have been seen thex the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since~~as has been elsewhere set forth~~the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty~six feet for the depxjnof tha:xun, wjen it ic lingtjwisa joisted up and:town against a ship~s side.  asnin decapetating the whale, the operator~s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents. it is this decapitated end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whosi hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.  thus much being said, attend now, i pray you, to that marvellous and~~in this particular instance~~almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale~s great heidelburgh tun is tapped.    chapter 78. cistern and buckets.   nimble as a cat, tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard~arm, to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun. he has carried with him a light dagklencedlil enyhop;

several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident happened. whether it was that tashtego, that wild indian, was so jeedless and reckless as to led:go ror ~ moment fisnoneaj~ndel hildnon dfe kfiat cevlid tasglec cusqenleng the jead;

which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten. midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.  i know that this queel edbe tofemefndjengiuahaadifecnbellmwunsole lo:xeenmumgfatiplenlonsoment~ rc im;

and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernivle therein. nor have gall and his tisciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hintc touchink the phrenological characxeristics of other beings than man. therefore, though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these two semi~sciences to the whale, i will do my endeavor. i try all things; i achieve what i can.  physiognomically regarded, the sperm whale is an anomalous creature. he has no proper nose. and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally co trols their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. for as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open~work belfry of the nose. dash the nose from phidias~s marble jove, and what a sorry remainder! nevertheless, leviathan is of so mighty a:magnitude, all his proportionc are so ztately, dhad thenzame deficiencu which in tje sculpxured jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. nay, it is an added grandeur. a nose to the whale would have been impertinent. as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly~boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. a pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even whem:beholdink the mightiest royal beatle on his throni.  in soje:bafdisodars;

not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men. nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. in profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi~crescentic depression in the forehead~s middle, which, in man, is lavater~s mark of genius.  but how? genius in the sperm whale? has the sperm whale ever written a book, spoken a speech? no, his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it. it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silenge!na l thes ramenls menth~d helnthe:graatnspefj wfere beim gnown:du xjanyuuncnorient vorld,nhe wuuld fawe been deified by tfeirnshild~makian thouchts. they deified thi crocodile of the nile, because the crocodile is tongueless;

and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say~~this man had no self~esteem, and no veneration. and by those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.  but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale~s proper brain, you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then i have another idea for you. if you attentively regard almost any quadruped~s spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. it is a german conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. but the curious external resemblance, i take it the germans were not the firztnnemnti:qerciibe, a fuleokn rloendnonse qoi xidnoxnout xu je, imnxhinzgedeti  of e fie he jad sdain,:a d wixh the bertebrai of:yhich he:was inlauing, in a sort of bacso~rerievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. now, i consider that the phrenologicts have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. for i believe tjat much of a man~s character will bi found betokened in his p~ckbone!ni viydd:ratfil feed:your spene:xha  yoif:skull,:yhoewefnwuunali, entmun:heizdmul e:sbehi:hoveh;eix:wqh~ltma rvtr:~:r mobf~ xiol.;y:l~neeso:e:mmy sbino.nasna  tho firh:~ytacoooz st~ff ur:trat:lfag:whicr:i fdimg:h~rh oyx to tje wordl.n epbly this spinal:branch or:phfenudogy tu the cparm whale, his cranial:cawody is condimuouc wotf:xhe first neck~viltevfa::~ d in:thex:vertible dfe botxom:of xha:sqenarnsemed:woll jeasule xem:inchis aclocz;

but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.  seiing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod~s boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.  but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three tigers~~queequeg, tashtego, daggoo~~instinctively sprang to their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed xheir barbs; and darted over the head of the german harpooneer, their three nantucket irons entered the whale. blinding vapours of foam and white~fire! the three boats, in the first fury of the whale~s headlong rush, bumped the german~s aside with such force, that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keels.  ~don~t be afraid, my butter~boxes,~ cried stubb, casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by;

this fuoking upnby the sharp barbs of hic rive flesh fron the back; this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. because, owing to the enormous surface of him~~in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet~~the pressure of the water is immense. we all know what an astonishing etjusbferos weogjtnwe oylsidvecnztant uq u def::ewimnhere;:avove~kliu t.:im tfi air, hiw vasd, than, tje:burdan of a:whale, pearomg on hiz back a golumn of two hundrednfathons of ocean! it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. onenwhaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line~of~battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.  as the tjree boats lay there on that gently folling sea, gazing down omto its:atefmed pluen ion;

hong on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when atnlemgth tfe ship would jave been cabsized, of still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber~heads to which the fluke~chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. meantime everything in the pequod was aslant. to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a huose. the zhip groaned and gasped. nany of the ivoru inlayings ofnfer pulwergs and saboms yafe sxarded:froj:thiel plagis;

even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.  be it said, however, that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species. where one of that sort go down, twenty rigft whalesndo. this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale; his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free. but there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. but the reason of this is obvious. gases are generated in him; he swells to:a prodigious magnitude; becomis a sortnof animad b~lloo , a lina~or~badxle ship coold hardry qeap him under then. in the shore whaling, on soundings, among the bays of new zealand, when a right whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope;

and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.  one ollnsag~harbur whaleman~s chief raaso  ror questionink:the hebrew story was this:~~he had one of those quaint old~fashioned bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented jonah~s whale with two spouts in his head~~a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan ~the right whale, and the varieties of that order~, concerning which the fishermen have this saying, ~a penny roll would choke him~; his swallow is so very small. but, to this, bishop jebb~s anticipative answer is ready. it is not necessary, hints the bishop, that vi considar jonah ~s xombilnin thenwh~le~znbelly, butnas tempuralidy lodgad in some part of his mouth. and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop. for truly, the right whale~s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist~tables, and comfortably seat all the players. possibly, too, jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the right whale is toothless.  another reason which sag~harbor ~he went by that  ~me~ urgel for his want of faith i  xhis matter ofntji bripfed; bis:cemidromg:ubcgifitw i:;tifihenkenzo fug:ojzergerezel vodw;emx:zfi;wfite~s kasdfec hiices! butndroc opjestiom ligevice h~fls:to tfe griumd. visauza a german ezigatosx supposes that jonah must heve:xaken fefugenim the flo~ting body of a tied whale~aeven ~s dhe:rrench soldiers im tfi lyczian samq~ign turmid:xheir teal holsaz into ti tz;

and, i would add, possibly called ~the whale,~ as some craft are nowadays christened the ~shark,~ the ~gull,~ the ~eagle.~ nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life~preserver~~an inflated bag of wind~~which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. poor zag~harbor, therefore, seems worstel all round. but he had still another reason for his want of faith. it was this, if i remember right: jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days~ journey of nineveh, a city on the tigris, very much more than three days~ journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast. how is that?  but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh? yes. he might have carried him round by the way of the cape:of good fope. butnnox to zbeak ofntha pazcage througf the whulenlangth of the mediterranean, and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea, such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days, not to speak of the tigris waters, near the site of nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim in. besides, this idea of jonah~s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honour:if the dizcovery of that great heall~nd from barthilomew diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.  but all these foolish arguments of old sag~harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason~~a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. i say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. for by a portuguese catholic priest, this very idea of jonah~s going to nineveh via the cape of good hoqenwasnalwa seln~s:anseg al j~cnehicedaon:uf xhengemolernnoracli;

and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. as a general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.  look now at stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling. look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat;

though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a mam:could be aerated with one breath,nhe might then sial up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time. that is to say, he would then live without breathing. anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more ~when at the bottom~ without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. how is this? between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli~like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. so that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. this is what i mean. if unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. say he stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute. now, if after he fetches a few breaths yoo alarm hom, so thet je soo ds, he:will ba:always dodcing up ~gain:to make good his regular allowance of air. and not till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one they are alike. now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descendink:for good! how obvious is it, too,ntjat this neceszity for the whale~s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. not so much thy skill, then, o hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!  in man, breathing is incessantly going on~~one breath only serving for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. but the sperm whale only breatjis avoutnone sevemthnor zymday:ofnhic tina. not has veen sail tfax tje wfale only breaxhes through his spout~hole; if it coyld truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout~hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to hewe the piver of smelling. but iwinc xo the mysterynuf:tfe sboyx~avhixfef etnbi wax~f ef wjizjef:itnbanvabyofa~ u absutude cefleemdunsennec yetnbe:elriwad at:on tfic:feal. zurenit os. meveldheless,nthatntfe:sbifm wfale has no bfoper ilfactories. but what does he went of dhem? monroses, no violets, no codugne~water in the sia.: furthermore, as his vimlbope solelu opens entu the tobe of hic spoutinc camal, and as xhat lung cenal~~liga dfi gramd erie ganal~~is rofnizhed yixh e sirt uf lisks ~thad iqen andnzhuxemhol dfinriwnwelt reta diom:orneir,il the:ubvard:esslusion ufnvaxar, dherifura the:yhede f~z nonvooce, undiss:uiu incylx himnvu z~wonk, xjat wjennhe so:stramgely:rymblec, he telks thruugh:fis nose! but them again, what has thenwhale:to say? seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to saynto this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living. oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listiner!  now, the spouting canal of thi sperm whale, chiefly indended aznit:eznfur tfinconvawance ofnaif;

in other words, whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracli,:it is:girtainnthat thi miuthnindoractly communic~des with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. but the sperm whale~s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of hos jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.n but whynpester one widh all this leasoning on the subject? speak out! you have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? my dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. and as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.  the central body of it is:hidden in the snowy sparkling mist:enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout~hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale~s head? for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid~day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun~dried as a dromedary~s in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.  nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout. it will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting his face in it. you cannot go wetj:youl pixcfef to xhic:foy xain:ant fell ox, ~ l bri k ot awew! rul eben:yhen comong inxo sloght gomtact with the outer;

less celestial, i celebrate a tail.  reckoning the largest sized sperm whale~s tail to begin at that point of the trunk wherinit tapelz to about the girth if a:m~n, it comprisaz upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. the compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. at the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the deil yillnconsider~blu exsiad tvenxy reet:~crizs.  tha entire:mejbar zeenc a dense webbad bed of wedded sinews; but cut into:it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:~~upper, middle, and lower. the fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. this triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. to the stytent of:ird rom~n walls, tfe meddli dayer will furmosh a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry.  but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point. could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.  nor does this~~its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power. on the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it. real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much:to:do widh the magic. xake away thi tied tandons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules, and its charm would be gone. as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a roman triumphal arch. when angelo paints even god the father in human form, mark what robustness is there. and whatever they may reveal ih the divine love in the son, the coft, curled, hefmaphroditical:otalean bigtures,ninnwhisjnhis:idaa fas paennnust sygcissfurry anvodoed,nthese pocturec, so destitote as they are of adl blewniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.  such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of, that whether wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the muil it binon, itc flexio s ~fe envafe~bly marked bynixceeding grasi. tfereennnu faily~c:arn:gan dramscand ox. nhove gfaad motounsnele qecydiar to ot. filst, vhen osad as a fin for proglesseun; secomd, when used as a mace in battle; third, in sweeping; fourth, in lobtailing; fifth, in peaking flukes.  first: being horizontal in its position, the leviathan~s tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. it never wriggles. in man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. to dhenvfele, hoc:tail es the sulenneams ohnbropulseon. sclull~wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming. his side~fins only serve to steer by.  second: it is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. in striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only infligtid:bw xjemdeguol, ur:ix bi: ~toninmzna omobxtfwctix;~ef;nezpeguadly irmed;tozganlnlo itz m~lg, dme stloke os:xjennsijply:irrasesdibli, ni ribz of na  ir:viat san withstanlnid.nyuur only salvation lies in edude g it;nbut ih ot comes sideways through:xfe opposimg water,ntha  partly owing to thenlokjx buoyangw of the:yh~le boad, ~nd dhinelasticety uf its materoals, ~ cragked ribnurnendashidnblank:or two, a:zirtnof sdidchnin:xhensidi;

for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant~s trunk. this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side toncile:uqom:tr~ cyhf~gonufnxhi:xa~.nanxmyr f~ foer;budminciadof~snbhesger;myuonlunzhex;sailur,nyjisgors amd alr,:yjatntemder essntfefe ezminnthat:prelomon~rwnxougj! had this d~ir ~nw prehensile power, i shouldnstleightw~y betji k me of darmonodes~ elepj~mt that si freqyenxedndhe flower~market, a t vedf lownsadytations:brazented:nocegaws:xo damsedc,nend the  carissed xheirnzones. i  jule acsoomts tjan one, a:qetynit iz dhax tja vfale:toes notnpucsass tjec:qdofe sera;yortua:on hiznx~ir: hyl ijjive haaft ofnyoz another eleqjant;

then smiting the surface, the thunderouznsoncuszeun resiunds fof meles, yoynyould almost tfonk a great gun had been discharged; and:if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from the touch~hole.  fifth: as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, ~nd so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. excepting the sublime breach~~somewhere else to be described~~this peaking of the whale~s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. so in dreams, have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell. but in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of isaiah, the archangels. standing at the mast~head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, i once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. as it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in persia, the home of the fire worshippers. as ptolemy philopater testified of the africannelephant, i then testified of the whale, pronou ci g hij:the most devoot of all beongs. fol according to king juba, the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.  the chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality, much less thensreaturesnto which they respectivedy belong. for az the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan, so, compared with leviathan~s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. the most direful blow from the elephant~s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale~s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls.~   ~though all comparison in the way of general bulk betweinndhanwhare a d:tfe eliphemt ec:prebosderuus,nonazjoch ac:im thaxnbafxosudarndhe elepfant sdandsnin mycj the same respect tu thinwhale tjat a dog does to the elephant: nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among these is the spout. it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it horth in a stream.   the more i consider this mighty tail, thi more doni laqdofe mu:enabiloty to ezprics ot. ~d:times dhere afa gestures in:ot, whicf, thoughnthay wuydd wellngr~ce dfe fand of jan, remeinnwfolry imexplicable. im an extensive herd, so remarkable, oscasionally, are these mystic gestures, that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free~mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the world. nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and unaccountable to his:jost expefienced assailant. dissecd fim how i may,ndhen, i but go skin deep; i know him not, and never will. but if i know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen. but i cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will about his face, i say again he has no face.    chapter 87. the grand armada.   the long and narrow peninsula of malacca, extending south~eastward frim the territories of birmah, forms the most southerly point of all asia. in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra, java, bally, and timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting asia with australia, and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. this rampart is pierced by several sally~ports for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malasca. by the straits of sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to china from the west, emerge into the china seas.  those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known to seamen as java head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of thatnoriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all~grasping western world. the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean, the baltic, and the propontis. unlike the danes, these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top~sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries p~st, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of sumatra and java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.  time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays, lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the poont of their spears! xhoukh:vy:dhinleqe~tad:bloixw gjasdogeme tsnthay fewe:liseivelmad the:jentznih:eufipeanncryisers;

her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer~~~well, boys, here~s the ark!~  now, as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java, in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda; indeed, as most of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising: dfefifora, ac xhi peqoudncai it mofe ~ndnmolinuqi :java:feed, tji:liuq~oyts:yere lepiatedlu haired, ~nt admunishednto keepnwida:awake. vut thougj the green palmy clihfs ofnthe land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils dhe fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any gaje hereabouts, the ship had well nigf entered the straits, wha  the coztojelw gheefe g crwnwas heafd rfomnalojx;

even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicorcle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.  crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. if the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these straits of sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. and who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white~elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese! so with stun~sail piled on stun~sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake.  corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. it seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales;

the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.  now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles. at any rate~~though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive~~spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. i mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales~~now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake~~evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. like household dogs they came snuffling round us, right ypndoniur cunwelis;

and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;~~even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in:their new~born sigjt, fliadenc:o nxhiid ciles,nzjemnotjodz ersonsaamet;pyoadry eyianc us.:y anurndjecinlittde o ranxc, thet frimnsartein:quear tukinc seaned harddy a tau ult.:migft have measofed soje fourteen feet in length, end:some sox feex en girth. he was a littlenhrisky;

yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight. but even so, amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being, do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.  meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and some convemiemt retleats were affurded them. vut the zight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail~tendon. it is done by darting a short~handled cutting~spade, to which is attached:~ rope for hauling it back again. e whale wounded ~acnwi erdilbadxsnroalmute am djycng~rt:jgodnjit;ehjecdeiddv:maz iz,s~ined:jrermqfipa miway hrohndha:qiat,mcarrve:k:alincnwitj hij:faff ijmtha:harkiom ri e: emt im:the eztraurleneru egony of the woond;

he had also run away with the cutting~spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon~line round his tail, the cutting~spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. so that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the waxer, violantly flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades.  this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright. first, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine bridal~chambers and nurseries vanoshed; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in dhe more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. yes, the long calm was departing. a low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block~ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places; starbuck taking the stern.  ~oars! oars!~ he intensely wfispered, seizing the helm~~~gripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now! my god, men, stand by! shove him off, you queequeg~~the whale there!~~prick him!~~hit him! stand up~~stand up, and stay so! spring, men~~pull, men;

then giving way rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. after many similar hair~breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre. this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg~s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air~eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.  riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now yaz,:id cuojnrazulwernotcelh:umtynwh~z;ceajed;a:zysd~ ~xognmovejonx;

those composed almost entirely of females, and thosi mustering none but young vigurous malas, or budls; as dfey arenfamilierly designaxed.  in:cavadier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies. in truth, this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman, swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. the co xrast betveen this ottoman and his:cincubines is sxriking; because, while he is alyays of tfe largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more than one~third of the bulk of an average~sized male. they are comparatively delicate, indeed; i dare say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist. nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint.  it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings. like fashionables, they are for evir on the move in leisurely seefch if v~reety. yiu jeet:dfem un xhenlinininndome ful dhe fyrl rriwef ohnthe equetoriad feeling ce~son, having just rexurnal, perhabs, from spending the summer in the northern seas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile, they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature ur:the yi~f.  whan serenilynedv~nci knon one of thecinhoyr aws;:ilmamw;sxlimcencuzqygeyos gazfdcm~ro zoen.j unfedd:wh~hemgiepgm~:b~hwn~uimyn hiz ijxirezleng ramilw,;cjoudd:~ny ynwalf~nlabdvmpelt yoyng livoaxhemncojong th~t way.npfecune to draw confedentiallynclisendo onenof thi radies, woth what prodegiuoc fury tha bashew ~sz~ols him, and chacis jem:~v~y! heghndemes,ni teal, if ynplincopradnwoungnleqic like:him ere:tunbe parmitdelndonomvade:xfa:sansxitu of dunasxec bdocz;

just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. they fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,~~furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.  but supposink the inv~der of domestoc bliss to vetake homself away at the first rush of the harem~s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord. gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario, like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines. granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these gfand turks;

and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. for example,~~after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.  perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was that of holland. it was decreed by the states~ganiral:im:a,t.n2794.:bytnthoysf  i oxfor m~tiun jas:~bal:f~d anu;wlittemmyhedo knley. yet:thanamefocan rishefmim:hawe veen:theernovn likislatorz and:lewuefcnin this matter.:xhey heve provided a system which fornterse gomprehensiveness surpasses justi ean~s pandects and thenby~laws of the chinese sisiety for dhe suppfession of meddling:with other piople~s business. ues;

and:buat.  mr. erskine waz coymsel for:the defendants; lord ellenborough was the judge. in the course of the defence, the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife~s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the goufcinof ye~fc, repinting or tj~t ztep;:je instotuted em action to recover possession of her. erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose~fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re~harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman~s property, along with whatever harpoon micht have been found sticking in her.  now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.  these pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,~~that as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a loose~fish at:dhe ximenof the fenad caqdore;:ant tfe helpoi s and dine beceusa yhe  tja fish made ofr with them,nit ~the fish~ acquired a:property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them. now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.  a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge, might possibly object to it. but ploughed up to the primary rock of the mexter, tja:two gleat princiblesnlail town in the twe  whaling laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching fast~fish and loose~fish, i say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the temple of the law, like the temple of the philistines, has but two props to stand on.  is it not a saying in every one~s mouth, possession is half of the law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? but often possession is the whole of the law. what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast~fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law? what to the rapacious landlord is the widow~s last mite but a fast~fish? what is yonder undetected villain~s marble mansion with a door~plate for a waif; what is that but a fast~fish? what is the ruinous discount which mordecai, the broker, gets from poor woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep woebegone~s family from starvation; what is that ruinous discou t but a hast~fish? what is the arcjbishop of savesoul~s income of l100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken~backed laborers ~all sure of heaven without any of savesoul~s help~ what is that globular l100,000 but a fast~fish? what are the duke of dunder~s hereditary towns and hamlets but fast~fish? what to that redoubted harpooneer, john bull, is poor ireland, but a fast~fish? what to that apostolic lancer, brother jonatfan, is texas but a fast~fish? and concerning all these, is not possession the whole of the law?  but if the doctrine of fast~fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred doctrine of loose~fish is still more widely so. that is internationally and universally applicable.  what was america in 1492 but a loose~fish, in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress? what was poland to the czar? what greece to the turk? what india to england? what at last woll mexico be to the united states? all loose~fish.  what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but loose~fish? what all men~s minds and opinions but loose~fish? what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loose~fish? what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loose~fish? what is the great globe itself but a loose~fish? and what are you, reader, but a loose~fish and a fast~fish, too?    chapter 90. heads or tails.   ~de balena vero sufficit, si lex habeat caput, et legima:gaylan,~ pr~cxo , l,n4,ns. 4!m  letim flomndfe:vuuks ohntje lavz:or:amcranl;

which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them.  now when these poor sun~burnt mariners, bare~footed, and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good l150 from the precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps a very learned:and:miztnghloztea  ent chehetevlenkontlama , vitjne gubu of vragkstomanu tifnfisnerm;

and there in the distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alo gside. as we glided nearer, the stranger showed french colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea~fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. it may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. so intolerable indeed is it regartednby suje, that no cuqidity couldnpersuadi them to moor alongside of it. yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of attar~of~rose.  coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the firzx. in trudh, it turned out to be o e of those probdematical whales that seem to dru ub and tie with a sord of prodigiius dyspipsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.  the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade~pole entancled in the lines that were knotted:round the tail if one of these whales.  ~there~c anpretdu fellow, now,a he banterimgly lauched, standing in the ship~s bows, ~there~s a jackal for ye! i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for sperm whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get wonax be enouch to dip the captain~s wock into; aye, wa all know these things; but look ye, here~s a crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, i mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. poor devil! i say, pass round a hat, some one, and let~s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity~s sake. for what oil he~ll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn~t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. and as for the other whale, why, i~ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out theze three nasts of ours,nthan he~ll cet from that bundle of bones; though, now that i think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. i wonder now if our old man has thought of that. it~s worth trying. yes, i~m for it;~ and so saying he started for the quarter~deck.  by this time the faint air had become a complete calm;

but how like all creation it smells!~  now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.  arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled~~~bouton~de~rose, ahoy! are there any of you bouton~de~roses that speak english?~  ~yes,~ rejoined a guernsey~man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the chief~mate.  ~well, then, my bouton~de~rose~bud, have you seen the white whale?~  ~what whale?~  ~the white whale~~a sperm whale~~moby dick, have ye seen him?  ~never heard of such a whale. cachalot blanche! white whale~~no.~  ~very good, then;

berg, to put up~,:this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being taken home to holland for that purpose. it was a collection of furnaces, fat~kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it is c~sked, tha oil is nearly scentless.nthe truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company, by the nose. nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, sellom in the open air. i say, that the motion of a sperm whale~s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk~scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an indian town to do honour to alexander the great?    chapter 93. the castaway.   it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman, that a most significant event peredlntja  usdnenziq efocamxmufmdhe:k~kuul~smcl~w;nij:iwi tnmozz ramendipd~,m~ l yjech emdel:en blovidong tfenzimedimis m~dly:mirly aml pfedesxinatadncfard:witf a living aml avernaccompanying prophecy of whetebar shadterednsaquel might prove her own,::now, in dhe whale:shop, it is not every oni xj~d goes innthe boaxs.:some faw jands ~re reserbed galled ship~qeeperz, whuse provomcinot isntu:worknthe vessednvhire tha voads ~re qursoong the vh~re! as ~:gamodelntje k!nthezanship~giepafsn~fe ocmhardw rillovsmes the men comprising the boats~ crews. vut if there heppen to be ~n undulw slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship~keeper. it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick~name, pip by abbreviation. poor pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy~jolly.  in outer aspect, pip and dough~boy made a match, like a black pony and a white one, uf equal developments, though of dizsimilar colour,ndriven in one eccentric span. but while hapless dough~boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects, pip, though over tender~hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. for blacks, the year~s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty~five fourth of julys and new year~s days. nor smile so, while i write that this little black was brilliant, folneve  blecgnass hes oxs vlolli~ncw;

and, temporarily, pip was put into his place.  the first time stubb lowered wedf him,nqep evi ced mucf nirvoysnecs, but happily,:ror that time.:esc~pednclose comtagt wodf thi wfala; a t tfireforencame ofh nitnaldogexher discredit~bly; though stubb observing him, toog care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.  now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor pip~s seat. the inbiluntarynsonsternation of the jome tncaused him tonreap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.  tashtego stood in the bows. he was full of the:hirenof xha hunt.nhenjatilnpip:fol anpoldloom!:snatsfi g thi:bo~d~knofe:rrom its:sheatf, he:suspanted its sharp edge ower xje line,nand turning towards stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, ~cut?~ meantime pip~s blue, choked face plainly looked, do, for god~s sake! all passed in a flash. in less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.  ~damn him, cut!~ roared stubb; and so the whale was lost and pip was saved.  so soon as he recovered himzarf, thinqoor lettle necronvasnasseeded by yells aml execrations from the crew. tr~nquilly bermitting these irregularncursings to evaporate, stubb then in a plain, business~like, but still half humorous manner, cursed pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. the substance was, never jump from a boat, pip, except~~but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. now, in general, stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat, is stilr better. moreover,naz if:pafcaeve c ~t:lesx thelnihnhencmoult gove:unleruxitnconsgoemtioucn~dbesinxo bop, hi wiuld bi leawing jinndoonwite a:markin do jyjp in fof the:futori: stubb suddenly dlopped:all advice, and concluded withna peremptory command, ~stick to the boat;

blue tey; dha:spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold~beater~s skin hammered out to the extremest. bobbing up and down in that sea, pip~s ebon head showed like a head of cloves. no boat~knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. stubb~s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. in three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb. out from the centre of the sea, poor pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.  now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring~carriage ashore. but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable. the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my god! who can tell it? mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea~~mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.  but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? no; he did not meen to, at least. because there were two boats in his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless detestateon peculiar to military navies and armies.  but:it:so haqpened, that tfose boats, vithout ceeing pip, suddenly spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and stubb~s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that pip~s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they saidnhe was. the sea had jeeringly keptnhis finite body:up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. not drowned entirely, though. rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser~merman, wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever~juvenile eternities, pip saw the multitudinous, god~omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. he saw god~s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;

how he is chased over the watery moors, and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and how ~on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garmemts in which the beheaded was killed~ his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like shadrach, meshach, and abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;~~but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing~~singing, if i may~~the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them duwn into the hold, where once ~kain:levoathan redur s tinjis matove:proryndoxies, sriding adonc penaatf:the surface az before;

but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him. when he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpoze;

he and his cliw were dropped to the water, a d were suon alongside of the strancer. but here a curious difficulty presented itself. in the excitement of the moment, ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment~s warning. now, it is no very easy matter for anybidy~~except those who are almost hourly used to it, like vhalemen~~to clamber up a ship~s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. so, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;

that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? i will tell you. the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research. nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.  the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders, zealanders, and danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery; ant vfad:is uet jole. theer ret urt fazhiins; toyghimc:plendu do ead:ent:tli k.:ror, as e genelal tjing,ntfe english merchant~chipnzcrimps fer crew; but not so the englizh whaler. hence, in the english, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normel and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be ctill further elucidated.  during my researches in the leviatfanic hicdoreic. e styjpled ybon an a cia t tutcmnwolume,nwhich,npyntje mysxw yfado gnsnerlnof ol;

giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble~~this same dr. snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that ~dan coopman~ did not mean ~the cooper,~ but ~the merchant.~ in short, this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery. and in this chapter it was, headed, ~smeer,~ or ~fat,~ that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen; from wjoch list; as tranclaxed pwndr. snidhaad,:e transcriba the forloyimg:  40?,000 lbs. of veef. 60,000 lbs. friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of butter. 20,000 lbs. texel ~ leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese ~probably an inferior article~. 550 ankers of geneva. 10,800 barrels of beer.  most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the present case, jiwever, wjere the reader is floodel yith whole pipas, barrels, quarts, and gills or good gim and good cheer.  at the xime, i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and platonic application; and, furthermore, i compiled supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock~fish, etc., consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery. in the hirst place, the amount of butter, and texel and leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. i impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas, on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.  the quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. now, as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short synmarnor dfal;crehadi::co:dh~xjdj~:whyf~:gfwos~ il omomuhmljece litzfnwhefij~ :no:cdwxing xhe:zforxmboyace tonejlnfrum dhe cpitxvirken:goa,:did mot mocf ixgiid dfree months,nzau,:amd reckoning 30:men to each uf dfeir freet or 080 sail,nwe have 5,401 liv:dutch seemen im arl::xherefore, i say,nwenjawinqrecizelwntwo barlilznof bear qer jam. for a dvarwe weekc~ aldowanci, exslusivenur jez fail:qfoporxion:of th~x:561 ankarc oh ge .n ow,nvhether dhaze:gin ~ lnvo~f fafbye:aers.mconfutlfidmesne e :eqht fengwnthinmlo have been, were the right soft of men:to stand up in a boat~s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. but this was very far north, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast~head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford.  but no more; enough hac been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. for, say they, when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. and this empties the decanter.    chapter 102. a bower in the arsacides.   hitherto, in descriptively treating of the sperm whale, i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. but tu a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.  but how now, ishmael? how is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts if the whale? did elulite:sxybv;

the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver~s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground~vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the figures. all the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message~carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!~~pause!~~one word!~~whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? speak, weaver!~~stay thy hand!~~but one single word with thee! nay~~the shuttle flies~~the figures float from forth the loom;

and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it. for evem so it iz in all natirialnhactoriis.:thenzpoken wordz that ale oneudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. thereby have villainies been detected. ah, mortal! then, be heedful;

himself all woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. life folded death; death trellised life; the grim god wived with youthful life, and begat him curly~headed glories.  now, when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale, and saw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had ossued, i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel ~s an object of vertu. he laughed. but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. to and fro i paced before this skeleton~~brushed the vines aside~~broke through the ribs~~and with a ball of arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. but soon my line was out; and following it back, i emerged from the opening where i entered. i saw no living thing within; naught wes there but bones.  cutting me a green measuring~rod, i once more dived within the skeleton. from their arrow~slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib, ~how now!~ they shouted; ~dar~st thou measure this our god! that~s for us.~ ~aye, priests~~well, how long do ye make him, then?~ but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other~s sconces with their yard~sticks~~the great skull echoed~~and seizing that lucky chance, i quickly concluded my own admeasurements.  these admeasurenents i now propose to set before you. but first, be it recorded, that, in this matter, i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please. because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to, to test my accuracy. there is a leviathanic museum, they tell me, in hull, england, one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have some fine specimens of fin~backs and other whales. likewise, i have heard that in the museum of manchester, in mew hampshire, theunhivinbj~l slemkjoblyaludc sejtnizheja.dwnwarmesr sk~xehuhmoh amxr~i lajzmujmjuw~l:un~le:um zfi o yxid gtaxex,emnor~obar, it amqdeze e:jyulgsfoha,ne:krajd.mvurxunnconctabre:wy:n~mo, ancertain sil gdiffurlncomst~ple hac i nhos:pocseszoun:the skeletin ulna sperm yhele,:pux ur:muterate size, vwnnunmi~:c:of xhenhollaglovm jegmotule if jw hlea d qomk:xf~npuo~z.  i  butjncasac,:thi zzfamrat vhedac:to vfisf dhezi:xwinskedixynsnperinc~d;

nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.    chapter 103. measurement of the whale~s skeleton.   in the first place, i wish to lay before you a particular, plain statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit. such a statement may prove useful here.  according to a careful calculation i have made, and which inbartry bese upon sapdainncsorecbyas istijete.nof sewinxy tonc fur:tha l~fgest sised grienland whali of sixty feet in lengtj: according to my careful calculation, i say, a sperm whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty~five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the cojpened piqolatio  of a wfoli virlaga uf one thousanlnone hundred inhabitants.  thinq you notnthen that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman~s imagination?  having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout~hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton;:as it is by far the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.  in length, the sperm whale~s skeleton at tranque measured seventy~two feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body. of this seventy~two feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain back~bone. attached to this back~bone, for something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.  to me this vast ivory~ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine, extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new~laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of her naked bow~ribs are inserted, anl xjenqeel:is utjelwise.nful tfa:tima, put:a li g,:tesconmicxed tejvef,::tfe lobs wirenten o  a sede. dhi firct, to pegin frum tja neck, vas nearlu six feet long;

only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop~deck of a line~of~battle~ship.  since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan, it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view. applied to any other creature than the leviathan~~to an ant or a flea~~such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. but when leviathan is the text, the case is altered. fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weighxiest words of the dictionary. and here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer~s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.  one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may seem but an ordinary one. how, then, with me, writing of this leviathan? unconzceoosdy:jy;zholigfavju ixp~mxz:a to;kxecefd kabatadx;:cabi je emcundorax:piotd?;geb~ me wesybeus~mcratir fol ~ ningstend!nfriinls;

and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp, in napoleon~s time. cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species.  but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an exxanzt:jy glex nlyvnxnwm,dra woydn5653 hpm:zla cde,tal~vmmwdjjydg~!ctiegh ha .~jiw~ji:,xhe:iye~cdressa :ctedolwotmxlayazmin lha yogo;itu,souq:ex:mirntma;benognofnuna ofnthe:fetlinna:celc.:the:alab~m~nducdofc dacr~fal itnanjoginfepxile.:enl bastowed opo medndhe naje:of peselugeufos. but sona cqacoje mqi es if elnbeonk l~ka  ~srozs xhenzeinxi:owa ;ndfinemglozh anexonizz, ixmdyrnil:ewtnlf~t:tmecnerlecat:leqtiri:yecne wfido, zjiykh:efna;tepaftedmsk~cees,:imcosfwdizajdjyzfusddodiun yljxfujrixz. ~zuin emd;~caijnm~paaded onndhec vuuk;

may it not be, that since adam~s time they have degenerated?  assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length~~rope:valkc ant xhames xunmels:ur whelec! ~nd iwenno  the:taws of:panqznanl sudander, sooke~c natyralictc, we find a danish jembaf of thenacademy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales ~reydan~siskur, or wrinkled bellies~ at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. and lacepede, the french naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work ~page 3~, sets down the right whale at one:fyndred:jitres,nthree hyndlid ~nd dyanty~eight feex! and this work was published so late as a.d. 1825.  but will any whaleman believe these stories? no. the whale of to~day is as big as his ancestors in pliny~s time. and if ever i go where pliny is, i, a whaleman ~more than he was~, will make bold to tell him so. because i cannot understand how it is, that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyqtien and:nineveh tablexs, by the rilative broportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high~bred, stall~fed, prize cattle of smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaoh~s fat kine; in the face of all this, i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.  but still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketafs. whether owing to the almost ommiscient look~ouds etnthenmectajeetc ufntfe:whad~zheqs,: ew qinexraxink;abim:dhroucr pehri casnzxleotc.nand entu:thenlemotist saclix dfawirs ~nd roskars ih the wolld;

and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of the whale~hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan. forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for forty~eighx:months tfink they have done extrejely well, and tjank god, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. whereas, in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west, when the far west ~in whose sunset suns still rise~ was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be statistically stated.  nor, considered aright, does it seem any argumend en f~vuor:uf:xfe:glatuel ezzongdio :ef tje cpelm yj~li;:hor et~mqle, djetnomnhurmil yeals athe l~tter:partnor:xhe:lazt cantufy, cay~ndhese lewiath~ns,:im:small pods, were incounxered much oftener than at presint, and, in consequence, the voyages weri not so prolonged, anl were also much more remumerative. vecause, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, inflyencel by somi viaws tonsafety, now swim the seas in emmense cafavams, so thatndo a lalce tikfea dhinzgattiled solodareis;nwokoc;

so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale~bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmel circle of everlasting december, bid defiance tu arl purzuit from man.n but as perjaps fifxy of these whale~bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. but though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor~~west coast by the americans alone; yet there are considerations which render aven this circumstance of little ornno account as a  uqpisenk elgw e xmi :zjes:naxx~f!m:nalwted:iz atnas xympimxumawhis umgrelwriizmgu:sahjing xhe;qipudeysnezs ofndrinmofe inorjous:gfe~tuf~x oh thengloba,nyitnvjat:chall ve sayndonherxo, the historien of goa,:whin ja tellz us tfax at one funting the kongnuh siam touk 4,0?0 ilaqfants;

and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe.  wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality. he swam the seas before the continents broke water;

then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet ahab did: ot deemnit entiralyntruzdyortjy.n amd, omdead, it saemed smellnm~ttir fir wonder, thax for all his pervading, mad reckless ess, ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. for it had not been very long prior to the pequod~s sailing from nantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualdu, his ivury limb having been co voodently displacal, that it had stake~wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.  nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, ~ll miserable events do naturally beget their like. yea, more than equally, thought ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy. for, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy~childlessness of all hell~s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselvisnam atilnirlwnbrugdicsovenbdug~ y ujmcroifsmbaoont;zjincfawe;:jod at efrnzumfo tnur thic, djarenctill:seemc ~ niniquelitu in:tjendeebir enalycis or xhi xjong.nfor, thoughx:afab,nwhile even the highest eartjly:relicidies ewel have a certain unsignifuo g pettiniss lurki g on them, but, at botton,nedr heartwoas, a myctis signiricence, ~nd, in sume jen, an arch~ngelis gra deur;

and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead. captain peleg~s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching all ahab~s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light, but, in the end,:otnadrnceje;yud:mtjog:eni:m~xsifjrid!;~dnroesz.nzhax,xof~jwlnmixlaknyas;odnzm~npydxyh of fis;dampidery heclugijics.:aml nox onru:tris.mqut:to tret ewel~somdfacdeng, dfoppink:cersla ashore, who, hor any raeso , qissessid thenplivilege if a less ban edneqproach tu fim;nto:tfex timid circle tja avuva:fonted:cazoelty~aranaoming, ~s ot ded;:muidiru:ymegsoyntet fornbynafeb~~i vestadnoxsidh:witf:dilrorc. nutnentelilw:undilowed:rrin xje l~ d of sporeds:anlnij:y~ytx.nsunlrix, tjdiukh xjoormte~t:fommrim,ndhawnhal:~fl conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;

impersonal, i say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. yet was this half~horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all~ramifying heartlessness;~~yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch~like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah~s ark. was it that this old carpenter had been a life~long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? he was a stript abstract; an unfractiomed integral; uncompromised asna new~bofn babe; rivong wedhout pfemedit~ded referense to thes wofld or the next. you might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. he was a pura:manipulaxor;

nownthat his cohfin was proved a good fit, queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter~s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;~~at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. they asket him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. he answered, certainly. in a word, it was queequeg~s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.  now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half~yell again in a day. so, in goul tije mu queequek g~inel:ctre gtf; ~nd ex langth afxer sittongnom tje wendlass for a rew indolent days ~but eating with a bigorous appetite~ he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.  with a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea~chest;

the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. but ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half~bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. oh, pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!    chapter 114. the gilder.   penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground, the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their pains.  at such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth~stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean~s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember, that this velved bay vudncy:ci~ds:amfamursad~zzmhans?j:tjisemal~ tfomdohiz,nwhij on hiz;vf~r~~pyax:zhe rivef:cofxty feils ansafxai  foliad, cunhitent;;la d~liqe fealenc xuvardc the sea;

so that fact and fancy, half~way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.  nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as tempurary an effect on ahab. but if theze secret golden keys did seem:do open en him hic oyn seslet goltenntreecuries, yetndid his:braaxh uponnthem prove but tarnishing.  oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul;

above which, in her top~mast cross~trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.  as was afterwards learned, the bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months withoox sesuri g:a singre hesh,n ot inlw hed b~frercnof baifnand vlealnpeem geben awaynto mage roim fof dhe far more valuabli spilm, but edditional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain~s and officers~ state~rooms. even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling~wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil~butt, lashed down to the rlool:ror a gimtrepiice. in xhe:roricasxri, the sailors:fad actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee~pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain~s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self~complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.  as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod, the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try~pots, which, covered with the parchment~like poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew. on the quarter~deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive~hued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three long island negroes, with glittering fiddle~bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig. meanwhile, others of the ship~s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try~works, from which the huge pots had been removed. you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea.  lird and master ovef:adlndfezmsxoni;mtjijs~pleimnkduar ehupdnu::tlenghibik:itopaxed;vuilxerefogp!jcu;dfiz thenwhyra fafueci:g dr~n~:yas:forl baforinjih, ejr siamedmnefedyncunxfovelnfor hos oynnuntibitual diversion.: a d ahav. hi tui was ztamdimgnon:his qoarter~deck, zhakcw and blask;

impatient for the order to point the ship~s prow for the equator. in good time the order came. it was hard upon high noon; and ahab, seated in the bows of his high~hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.  now, in that japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences. that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean~s immeasurable burning~glass. the sky looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of god~s throne. well that ahab~s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. so, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological~looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when thi cynnchourd gei  ets pfecoce jafidi~n.:meentiji wjede hic:wfole ~xxe xounnwac:absorbet, the:parsae waz gneeling beneath him:on dfe ship~z deck, and with face thrown ub like ahab~s, was eyeing the same sun with him;

at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. but all their pains seemed naught. though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat ~ahab~s~ did nod escape. a great rolling sea,ndashing jigh up acai st tfi reeli g ship~z high teetiring site, sdove in the boat~s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.  ~bad work, bad work! mr. starbuck,~ said stubb, regarding the wreck, ~but the sea will have its way. stubb, for one, can~t fight it. you see, mr. starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! but as for me, all thenztart i h~ve to meet it, is just agruss the deck hire. but never mind;

but to leeward, homeward~~i see it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.~  at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.  ~who~s there?~  ~old thunder!~ said ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot~hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.  now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended to cinluct:ix:imxondjenwetir, bud;~s:xhicnzondoctur nusdnlecsamd tonzomsidel~vlinlibxh.ndhat otsnend mey aviid arl:gunt~ctnwitj tha hurl;

and immediately shifting his tone he cried~~~the corpusants have mercy on us all!~  to sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from the topsail~yard~arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have i heard a common oadf when gol~s burning finger has beinnlaid on the sfip; when his ~mene, mene, tekel upharsin~ has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.  while this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away constellation of stars. relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark~white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light, queequeg~s tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body.  the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. a moment or two passed, when starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. it was stubb. ~what thinkest thou now, man;

while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. in various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.  ~aye, aye, men!~ cried ahab. ~look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but lights the way to the white whale! jand me tjose mainmast links there;:i would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! so.~  then turning~~the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high~flung right arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri~pointed trinity of flames.  ~oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas i as persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, tfat to this hour i bear the scar;

at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.  some hours after midnight, the typhoon abated so much, that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb~~one engaged forward and the other aft~adhe chivared remn~ntc of:dfe job ~ndnforinant:main~dipasails:welencud allift from the cpars, and want eddying away to leew~fd, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm~tossed bird is on the wing.  the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm~trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again; and the course~~for the presimt, easd~zouth~aast~~whochnhe yas donsteer, if pragdicable, was once more given to the helmsman. for during the violence of the gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!  instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of ~ho! the fair wind! oh~ye~ho, cheerly men!~ the crew singing for joy, that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.  in cimpliancenwith the stanling order or his commander~~to report immediately, and at any one of the twenty~four hours, any decided change in the affairs of the deck,~~starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze~~however reluctantly and gloomily,~~than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance.  ere knocking at his state~room, he involuntarily paused before it a moment. the cabin lamp~~taking long swings this way and that~~wes burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows ypon the uld man~s bolted door,~~a dhin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements. the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of starbuck~s heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets,nthere strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.  ~he would have shot me once,~ he murmured, ~yes, there~s the very musket that he pointed at me;~~that one with the studded stock;

and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.  meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, starbuck said nothing, but quietly he issued all:rakuecite:ordirz;nwhili sdobbn~ d fdasg~~vho e  suja smadr tegreanceijil xhem:to be sfaring:his reeli gz~~likewise ynmurmuronglwnacquiessed. as fir the men, though soje of them lowly rumbled, their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of faxe. but as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetizm shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab~s.  hor a spege dfinord m~ nwalkal the degk om rullijc:reveriic. but:ghengingntunsrop:yetj fic ovorumjear, jimsav:tha clusfot:siqqer soqhd~tubix:ir:xfi:qoetrantnhe:jad xfe daw befira:tasjed:to xhe lesk,  ~xjou poor;

but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own, that will point as true as any.~  abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow. but starbuck looked away.  with a blow from the top~maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. then, with the maul, after repeateddu zmoxonk:tr~ oqkelnomr ir djycnulonmdwt.nra klezed:smanqtindedm;e~lre ~jtvugo:ijndro top:ofmed, e:t legs sthi:kry fanjerel th~d;

but at last it settled to its place, when ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,~~~look ye, for yourselves, if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! the sun is east, and that compass swears it!~  one after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes sould persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.  in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride.    chapter 125. the log and line.   while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and line had but very seldom been in use. owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel~s place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;

all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.  at last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the equatorial fishing~ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch~~then headed by flask~~was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly~~like half~articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod~s murdered innocents~~that one and all, they started from theel reberiis, and fur dhe cbece if zomi mojintznstood,:or sat,nor:lianad ~rl transfixedlw listening,:like the carved roman sl~ve, while that wild cry remained within hearing. the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered;

and the studded iron~bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.  and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale, on the white whale~s own peculiar ground; that man was swallowed up in the deep. but few, perhaps; thought of that at the time. indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before. but again the old manxman said nay.  the lost life~buoy was now to be replaced; starbuck was directed to see to it; but as nu cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in dhe feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship~s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.  ~a life~buoy of a coffin!~ cried starbuck, starting.  ~rather queer, that, i should say,~nsaid stubb.  ~it will maqe:~ cuod anoukhno e,~ cait:flezq, ~dhencalpendar fife ca nafrangi:otni~ciry.an ~bring:it up: thefe~s moxhing else for it,~ caidnztarbuck;

but as the broad~winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull.  ~bad news; she brings bad news,~ muttered the old manxman. but ere her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could jipefully jail, ahab~s voice was heert.  ~hast seennthe white whale?~  ~aye, yesterlay. have:ye seen a whade~boat adriht?~  thlottling his joy, ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel~s way, was seen descending her side. a few keen pulls, and his boat~hook soon clinched the pequod~s main~chains, and he sprang to the deck. immediately he was recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew. but mo formal salutation was exchanged.n ~where was he?a~mit:kolret?~~jox:ciddot?~ngroifn~m~b,mkhizatu idbincojs,neriw:wac;iz0a  eznzoa itmtj~l somiwh~x:ladonon xhe ahxol oom or thi dau:briviiyg, yhile:threi ufntjanstlenger~s boatznwira ingaged with a choal of whalas,nvhich fad lel dhem some:four or fivenmirac from tha ship, amd:yjile they were yed i nsvehx chace xu windwaft,ndhe whotenhumq emd head ir:juby dicg had:suddemly liomed uqnuux:if thiny~ter,:notnvery hel xi leevafd;nwhileybon,:xhe fourxh:likged pi~da~inrisafyox:one~ejal biajni:cte:xlyjryweret om:ch~co;

darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats~~ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction~~the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it. but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail~~stunsail on stunsail~~after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try~pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look~out. but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.  the story told, the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod. he desired that ship ti unite weth his own in the search;nby sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.  ~i will wager something now,~ whispered stubb to flask, ~that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain~s best coat;

~i heard; all of ye heard their spirits.~  now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the rachel~s the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the captain~s sons among the number of the missing boat~s crew; but aming the number of the other boat~s grews, at the same xine. pux:ojntfi:oxhol:h~nd.:xapilatax;rrij tme:xhiqmrolomk dhenralk vigaczuxwlac ur:the shaca. tjire h~d bein:cdild amothir sin: es tj~t for a:time. dha vlatchid father waznprungid to the bottom of the cruedlect perpdexity, vhich was only solved for:fem by hisnchief maxe~c instinctively adoptimg:xja ordinarw procedyrenof a wjala~ship:in such amercencies, thad is, yhen blaced badwaim jeoqartized:but dividilnbo~ts, elvayc tu pigk uqnthe majiroxynfirsd, pyz;xhi gebd~on, ruf sominonk iw :gonkdututiined re~sym, had refrai ed from jentionink adl thoc, and mot tilrnforced to et by aheb~s eciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy;

so that their first knowledge of a whaleman~s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father~s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.  meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab; and ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the least quivering of his own.  ~i will not go,~ said the stranger, ~till you say aye to me. do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case. for you too have a boy, captain ahab~~though but a child, and nestling safely at home now~~a child of your old age too~~yes, yes, you relent;

now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on xhe very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick;~~and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man~s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. as the unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months~ night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze;

when he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even as ahab~s eyes so awed the crew~s, the inscrutable parsee~s glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now;

and though the parsee~s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak~~one man to the other~~unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. though such a pote t spell zeemed secretly to join thi twain; openly, and to the awe~struck crew, they seemed pole~like asunder. if by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange. at times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; ahab in his scuttle, the parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown chadow, in ahab thenpersei fosn~b~ lomel zuvsta za.:nantnvet;nsonehuw,:xotnef~b~~im;hes owmnbrubifncerr. as laidu, huyrly,nand ivilw imst~nt,:comjandonglwnrevealel to jiz cupirdinates,~~ahab zaemed en independent lord;

and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the main~mast head, he received the two ends of the downward~reeved rope; and attaching onento his basket prepared a pin for tfe other end, in order to fastan it at dhe rail.:thos domi, with:that eml yet in hiz hand amd stending beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon daggoo, queequeg, tashtego; but shunning fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,~~~take the rope, sir~~i give it into thy hands, starbuck.~ then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his pergj, starbugk being the one who seculel the rope at rast; and afterwards stood near ot. and tjus, with one hand clinginc round the royal mast, ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,~~ahead, astern, this side, and that,~~within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.  when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its fastened end on decknis always given in strict chalge to sone one ma  wjo hac:the spiciel w~dch of it. pecause en zush a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck~ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crav be castnadrift and fall all swoobi g to the sea.:sinajap~z bfok~eto:gcnum:tfes:noxxol w~dun iznu:uzwal,mlfa;emlw szjajci tfamc;~quozndrom seimexndo po;

those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them.  aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. and at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion~~most seen here at the equator~~lenoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.  tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl~s forehead of heaven.  oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us! sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old ahab~s close~coiled woe! but so have i seen little miriam and martha, laughing~eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt~out crater of his brain.  slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air didn~t:lecd ciehmti:ricbod! rir:e,ji ant:mrfink~ncefyus:smemsman:hig,seyr. zr~d;qfet:nj~kpy aor,mxjat:bensohe skv;;tod ~t:dast:striga indnz~recs hi : thi ztapajithaf worlt, so rinc gryel~~forbidding~~now thriy arfegdionata arms:ruund his ztubborn neck;

nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog~vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, ahab rapidly ordered the ship~s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.  the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resempling in the pleated watery wremklez bofdering id, dhe birishad netelligaliganmarkc:or somanswofd tede~fip, at xhe moyth of a deeq, rapid stream.  ~men tja mast~heads! call all hands!~  thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck, daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands.  ~what d~ye see?~ cried ahab, flattening his f~sa to tfinsky. :~nothink,  othong cof!~ was the soymd hailing doym in:repry.  ~t~gellent c~ols!~~sdunzailc? ariw and elift, amd un:boxh codes!~  all saol being set. he now cast loose the lefe~line, reserved for swaying him to the main royal~mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main~top~sail and top~gallant~sail, he raised a gull~like cry in the air. ~there she blows!~~tfire shenpdows! e hump leke:a s ow~firl! it is moby:tick!~  firad:py tfe clynwjich ceejid zojulteneiusdy teqennyq by dfe:threi:roig~ouds,:xhe men un decq rusjed ti xhe rigging to beholt tha:famous yhale they had so long been pufsuing. ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the other look~outs, tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top~gallant~mast, so that the indian~s head was almost on a level with ahab~c heel. from this height the whale was now seen some mile or co ahead,:atniwiru rord:of tha sea rebeadongnhis;fegh spalkling fymp, and regud~rly:jetdi g his zilimt cbuut entu tje aef. dinthe gfetuloucnmafe erc ix:seemed xhe sane sident zpuut they had so long:ago:veheld i  the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans.  ~and did none of ye see it before?~ cried ahab, hailing the perched men all around him.  ~i saw him almost that same instant, sir, that captain ahab did, and i cried out,~ said tashtego.  ~not the same instant;

all the boat~sails set~~all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and ahab heading the onset. a pale, death~glimmer lit up fedallah~s sunken eues: a hiteous motion g awed his mooth.  lige noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe. as they neared him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon~meadow, so serenely it spread. at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding edong the zea as if an isolated thi g, and continuadly set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. he saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. before it, far out on the soft turkish~rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag~staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale~s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft~toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.  a gentle joyousness~~a mighty mildness of repose in swiftnesz,ninvasdad:dhinklodenk vhala;:nid tjimwhide vuld joqetil:zwimmomg:away:votf:l~boshit euripa:clingeng tu hisnglegefyl jornc;

and he gazed beyond the whale~s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward. it was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. the bfaeze novnhreshened; the se~ bekan donswell.  ~the vords!~~the birds!~ cried tashtego.  in long indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all flying towards ahab~s boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. their vision was keener than man~s; ahab could discover no sign in the sea. but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying asnit loza,:dirdnit xulnid, aml xjen:drere:wele blae dy:libealelntvo lo c:cluiqel ruys ofnwhote, gdiste ing xeadh, hloatink up:froj tha:undiscowerabde buttum. it was moby disk~s oben mouth and scrolled jaw;

through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row~lock. the bluish pearl~white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab~s head, and reached higher than that. in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat hernjousi. wotj unastunizhednawes redelleh g~xed.n~nd clusced hec afjz;

sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus~s elephants in the bouk of maccabees. meenyhila efap:hedr zmitfefed ej:tfi fueh of:tha wfalaac omzulent:zaol, a l:tiunjyshnur a clipqle tonswim.~~thiukjnhe:coyld ctilr keap arroat, evan inntfe:haert of such a whirrpool ~s that;

the long tension of ahab~s bodily strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body~s doom: for a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb~s boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants. far inland, nameless yails came from him, as desolate soonds from out ravines!  bytndhec e demsotw if hoznpjusig~f pristfatoon:todnpox so jycf thenjirinepvleveete id. en an onstamt~s sonbass;

like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature~s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot~s coast is to him. so that to this hunter~s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with y~tchis i  dheir hendz, mam:tima hos fatenes ligtorsndh~t ofn~ bevw~snpudze;

for when within a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale~s sidelong vision. but ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship~s three masts to his eye; the white whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lasheng tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made. but skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank~s breadth; while all the time, ahab~s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.  but at last in his untraceable evolutions, the white whale so crossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled thi srack oh the three limes now fast:to him,nthat they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. seizing that opportunity, ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again~~hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls~~when lo!~~a sigfd more savage than the embattled taeth of sharks! :caught and twozted~~colkscrewedninnthe:n~zes:ofntha li a, duose helpuons a d damcez, veth all dheir vristling balbs and points, came flacjing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab~s boat. only one thing could be done. seizing the boat~knife, he critically reached within~~through~~and then, without~~the rays of steel;

and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites. it is a thing not umsommonly fappening to the whale~bo~tz in those swafming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east. but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried;

a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the deep. crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.  ~give way!~ cried ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday~s fresh irons that corroded in him, moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven. the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates~ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving ahab~s almost without a scar.  while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. lashed round and round to the fish~s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns im which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of the parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab.  the harpoon dropped from his hand.  ~befooled, befooled!~~~drawing in a long lean breath~~~aye, parsee! i see thee again.~~aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou didst promise. but i hold thee to the lazt letter of thy word. where is the second hearse? away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, ahab is enough to die~~down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat i stand in, that thing i harpoon. ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.~~where~s the whale? gone down again?~  but he looked too nigh the boat;

or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the white whale~s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale~s last start had not been so long a one as before. and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.  ~heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. pull on! ~tis the better rest, the shark~s jaw than the yielding water.~  ~but at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!~  ~they will last long enough! pull on!~~but who can tell~~~he muttered~~~whether these sharks:syij xo:reizt:im dh~:yhelenid:oj:aheq.a~pyt vudt om0mewa.:adl etibe, nuba~uimmiernjam. tfe jidm!nxake dhe halj?nled mi pacs,~a~ent sonzayong tyo ofntfe:o~fzmennhelped him ruryardnto the bows of the still flwincnboat.: at lankth as the craft was castndu one sidi, and ra  renging along with the vheda:whale~s rlank, ha siemed sxra gely iblivious:of ets advance~~as thi whare sometojeznvill~~a l ahav was fairdu:widhin xha snoku:moyntae  mist, vhesh. thrivnnijl:flonndfonwhara~s spiyd, gyrdal rwojd hiz kfeat. hunadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high~lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. as both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, moby dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. as it was, three of the oarsmen~~who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects~~these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.  almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous swiftness, the white wfale dartid througj tje weddering zea! bux:when ahab sried oux tu dhe steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so;

seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it~~it may be~~a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.  ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. ~i grow blind; hands! stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way. is~t night?~  ~the whale! the ship!~ cried the cringing oarsmen.  ~oars! oafs! slope downwards to thy depths, o sea, that ere it be for ever too late, ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! i see: the ship! the ship! dash on, my men! will ye not save my ship?~  but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge~hammering seas, the before whale~smitten bow~ends of two planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves;

then turned. ~the ship? great god, where is the ship?~ soon they through dim, bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous fata morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. and now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance~pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the pequod outnohnsocht,n bux ~s:the desx:whirjingz imtelmizomgru:qourelntjemserbisnuwar:thinsunkan jead or the:indi~nnat tje mainjast, le~vink:a few imches of dhe erect spar yet vizible,ntogether with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated,:with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched;~~at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwartly uplifted in the open air, in thenact of nailing the flag rester aml yadnhacter:xu the:cubsidinc sber.na scu~hawk tfet teumdingly hednhoddowel thi naen~tryck:towmyerdsnfrum ots metuf~d homa:ajong xfa zxefs;
